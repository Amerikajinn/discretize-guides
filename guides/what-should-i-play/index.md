This page introduces all the builds on this website by giving a very short overview over the gameplay. It may help you to choose the right class for your very own playstyle. Generally there are three types of builds: DPS, offensive support and defensive support builds. A META team for example is only running DPS and offensive support builds.

Outline:
1. **META:** These builds perform best in a group. [Click here](/guides/meta-explained) to find more out about how and why the current fractal META works well. The META is designed to provide the fastest clear across all fractals.
2. **OFFMETA:** Builds in this category can substitute builds of the META category, but will provide worse performance in an optimal scenario.
3. **OTHER:** These builds are played mostly for fun, to carry individuals or with niche uses like more cleave, boon generation and skips.

<Card specialization="Soulbeast">
| Build | Synergy | DPS | Independence | Basics | Mastery | 
| ---- | --------- | -- | ------------| ------ | ------- |
| [<Specialization name="Soulbeast" disableLink />](/builds/ranger/soulbeast) | <Rating value="5"/> | <Rating value="5"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | 

<Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> is a DPS build with very high burst damage that also provides strong party buffs with <Skill name="Frost Spirit"/> and <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/>, some <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> and crowd control (CC) skills. Furthermore, <Skill name="Whirling Defense"/> is an exceedingly strong reflect skill that comes in handy on several encounters (e.g. Artsariiv). The build benefits from slaying potions such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

This build is rather self sufficient due to:
- <Boon name="Quickness"/> from <Trait name="livefast"/> 
- <Boon name="Might"/> from <Trait name="Huntersgaze"/>
- Boon extension by <Trait name="Essence of speed"/>, <Skill name="We heal as one"/> 
- High CC with <Skill id="45743"/>, <Skill name="pointblankshot"/> and <Skill name="pathofscars"/>
- High mobility via <Skill name="monarchsleap"/>, <Skill id="45743"/> and <Skill id="12521"/>

Overall this is a very well rounded build that is rewarding to play in both PuGs and organized teams alike.

<Card specialization="Weaver">

| Build | Synergy | DPS | Independence | Basics | Mastery | 
| ---- | --------- | -- | ------------| ------ | ------- |
| [<Specialization name="Weaver" disableLink />](/builds/elementalist/weaver) | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="5"/> | <Rating value="2"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | 
The <Specialization name="Weaver" text="Power Sword Weaver"/> is currently one of the strongest DPS builds for fractals. <Specialization name="Weaver" text="Power Sword Weaver"/> provides conjures, <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>, and additional <Boon name="Might"/> through placing fire fields and blasting them. Also it is very useful for some t4 skips like Aetherblade, Cliffside, Thaumanova Reactor etc. thanks to high mobility and <Skill id="5536"/>.

Unfortunately this build is pretty squishy and besides the healing skill does not have any defensive abilities to mitigate damage or cleanse conditions, so high awareness is required. Special care needs to be taken on fractals with <Instability name="We Bleed Fire"/>. 

Also this build depends pretty much on supports and boon uptimes, as it cant provide any boons itself besides some <Boon name="Might"/> by blasting fire fields. This build has one of the most fluid rotations in game which makes it enjoyable to play if given some dedication. The build benefits heavily from slaying potions and sigils such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

<Card specialization="Berserker">

| Build | Synergy | DPS | Independence | Basics | Mastery | 
| ---- | --------- | -- | ------------| ------ | ------- |
| [<Specialization name="Berserker" disableLink />](/builds/warrior/berserker) | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="2"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | 
The <Specialization text="Banner Berserker" name="Berserker"/> is the strongest build for <Specialization name="Warrior"/> in fractals.

Besides providing the group with strong unique damage buffs through the stats of <Skill name="Banner of Strength"/> and <Skill name="Banner of Discipline"/> and having excellent defiance bar damage in <Skill name="Tremor"/> and <Skill name="Headbutt"/>, the build also has medium burst and excellent sustained damage. <Specialization name="Warrior"/> can provide half of the necessary <Boon name="Might"/> and <Boon name="Fury"/> to the group by using <Skill name="Forgreatjustice"/>.

The <Specialization text="Banner Berserker" name="Berserker"/> is one of the classes that benefit a lot from higher agony resistance due to not being able to crit cap by buffs and traits alone.

Furthermore, the build is able to use damage modifying sigils like <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/> as well as slaying potions such as <Item name="Powerful Potion of Slaying Scarlets Armies"/>. As a <Specialization text="Banner Berserker" name="Berserker"/> your focus is to maintain your unique party buffs and instantly contribute to breaking defiance bars, all while making DPS players sweat nervously when they glance at their DPS meter.
</Card>

<Card specialization="Renegade">

| Build | Synergy | DPS | Independence | Basics | Mastery | 
| ---- | --------- | -- | ------------| ------ | ------- |
| [<Specialization name="Renegade" disableLink />](/builds/revenant/renegade) | <Rating value="5"/> | <Rating value="2"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="5"/> | 
<Specialization name="Renegade"/> is the profession with the most support and utility among all META classes. It provides permanent <Boon name="Alacrity"/>, half of the necessary <Boon name="Might"/> with <Skill name="Heroic Command"/>, a unique buff over 150 <Attribute name="Ferocity"/> with <Trait name="Assassins Presence"/>, an insanely strong party heal and additional damage with <Skill name="soulcleavessummit"/>, and if that is not enough already, the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> has also excellent CC capabilities with <Skill name="Surge of the mists"/> and <Skill name="Darkrazorsdaring"/>. 

Damage wise the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is on the lower end compared to the other META classes. This does not imply that the damage doesn't matter: in fact <Specialization name="Renegade"/> has a very juicy burst that makes slacking DPS player sweaty. 

Since the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is a power-oriented build it benefits from  <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

<Card specialization="Firebrand">

| Build | Synergy | DPS | Independence | Basics | Mastery | 
| ---- | --------- | -- | ------------| ------ | ------- |
| [<Specialization name="Firebrand" disableLink />](/builds/revenant/renegade) | <Rating value="5"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="2"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | 
The **<Specialization text="Power Quickness Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/>** (also **_Quickness Firebrand_** or **_Quickbrand_**) provides permanent <Boon name="Quickness"/> to the party while dealing decent DPS.

It plays very similar to <Specialization text="Power Dragonhunter" name="Dragonhunter"/> with the addition of <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> mantras and tomes. Thanks to those, the build is able to adapt to various situations with <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Resistance"/>, reflects and pulls.

Using <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> to break defiance bars also increases your allies' <Attribute name="Power"/> by 216 for 10 seconds thanks to <Trait name="Perfect Inscriptions"/>.

<Message>
Its worth to mention that *<Specialization text="Power Quickness Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/>* is exceedingly strong when bosses phase quickly. For various T4 fractals, long fights or if you happen to be in a slower group (most PuG groups), you want to run *<Specialization text="Condition Quickness Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/>* ([Build](/builds/guardian/condi-firebrand) ) as it provides much higher sustained DPS.

<Card specialization="Firebrand" title="Condi Firebrand">
| Build | Synergy | DPS | Independence | Basics | Mastery | 
| ---- | --------- | -- | ------------| ------ | ------- |
| [<Specialization name="Firebrand" disableLink />](/builds/guardian/condi-firebrand) | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="5"/> | <Rating value="2"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | 

The **<Specialization text="Condi Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/>** provides permanent <Boon name="Quickness"/> to the party while dealing high consistent DPS. In organized teams this build is inferior to <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Power Firebrand"/> because it takes too much time to ramp up the damage. For slower groups however you can achieve very competitive results making DPS players sweat. Your tomes are by far your most important skills, they enable you to do great DPS as well as support and heal your allies. Thanks to those, the build is able to adapt to various situations with <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Resistance"/>, reflects and pulls. 

This build has tremendous amounts of self-sustain and is therfore also a great build for soloing content:
- Permanent <Boon name="Quickness"/>.
- Permanent 25x Might if you swap to <Trait name="zealous scepter"/>.
- <Skill id="41780"/> for heals.
- <Skill id="42259"/> for <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Resistance"/>, reflects and damage reduction.
- Optionally: <Skill name="litanyofwrath"/> for a 6s long high HP regeneration.
 
One main downside of <Specialization text="Condi Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/> is that you lack CC (Crowd Control), and missing the unique party wide +216 <Attribute name="Power"/> buff provided by <Skill name="Bane Signet"/>. 

Overall this build is one of the best picks for newer players, for PuGs as <Boon name="Quickness"/> provider or for people that want to be more independant of their groups.

<Card specialization="Holosmith" title="Power Holosmith">
| Build | Synergy | DPS | Independence | Basics | Mastery | 
| ---- | --------- | -- | ------------| ------ | ------- |
| [<Specialization name="Holosmith" disableLink />](/builds/engineer/power-holosmith) | <Rating value="2"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | 
The engineer build that currently fares best in fractals is the <Specialization text="Power Holosmith" name="Holosmith"/>, offering a mix of high damage and a relatively good amount of crowd control and utility in form of <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> and some <Condition name="Blinded"/>, <Condition name="Crippled"/> and <Condition name="Immobile"/>.

The build benefits from slaying potions such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.
</Card>


<Card specialization="Reaper" title="Power Reaper">
| Build | Synergy | DPS | Independence | Basics | Mastery | 
| ---- | --------- | -- | ------------| ------ | ------- |
| [<Specialization name="Reaper" disableLink />](/builds/necromancer/power-reaper) | <Rating value="1"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="2"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | 
The <Specialization name="Reaper" text="Power Reaper"/> is one of the best picks for players wanting to be more independent of their party. Due to large amounts of self-produced <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>, <Boon name="Quickness"/> and <Boon name="Might"/> it is good in parties where your teammates do not perform very well.

<Specialization name="Reaper" text="Power Reaper"/> has multiple offensive skill options (<Control name="Pull"/>, boon corruptions for <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/>, <Condition name="Blinded"/>, <Condition name="Immobile"/>, etc.) <Specialization name="Reaper" text="Power Reaper"/> can modify itself to fit many given situations in fractals.

It benefits from slaying potions such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.
</Card>


<Card specialization="Dragonhunter" title="Power Dragonhunter">
| Build | Synergy | DPS | Independence | Basics | Mastery | 
| ---- | --------- | -- | ------------| ------ | ------- |
| [<Specialization name="Dragonhunter" disableLink />](/builds/guardian/power-dragonhunter) | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="2"/> | <Rating value="4"/> | 
The <Specialization name="Dragonhunter" text="Power Dragonhunter"/> was moved to the [offmeta](/builds/) due to the fact that you can not replace a <Specialization name="Weaver"/> or <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/>. <Specialization title="Power Dragonhunter" name="Dragonhunter"/> is a meta build only if it replaces <Specialization name="Firebrand" /> and being the main source of <Boon name="Quickness"/> by taking <Skill name="feelmywrath"/>, which is used only in short encounters in higher end groups. 

<Specialization name="Dragonhunter" /> is good and easy to play build for fractals. It has great burst options and deals high consistent damage while providing medium defiance bar damage and <Condition name="Vulnerability"/>.

The build offers a unique party wide offensive buff by sharing <Skill name="bane signet"/> for 216 <Attribute name="Power"/> and also strong on-demand defensive support with <Skill id="30039"/> and other useful skills such as <Skill id="9251"/>, <Skill name="standyourground"/>.

Compared to other builds the <Specialization name="Dragonhunter" text="Power Dragonhunter"/> is rather self-sufficient thanks to blocks from <Skill name="Shieldofwrath"/>, <Skill name="shieldofcourage"/> and a very strong heal skill (<Skill name="litanyofwrath"/>) that makes the player invincible for 6 seconds.

It benefits from slaying potions such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

<Message>
This build is very common in PuGs. It is part of a composition called PuG meta, you can read more about it [here](/guides/meta-explained). We **recommend** to play [Heal Renegade](/builds/revenant/heal-renegade) for statics who are starting out and know the mechanics (after around 9000-15000+ <Item id="94020"/>). This recommendation is because  <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> can deal way more damage than <Specialization name="Renegade"/> (Leading to higher group DPS). However if you fail mechanics <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> is a way to success.
</Message>

It provides permanent <Boon name="Quickness"/>, <Boon name="Regeneration"/>, <Boon name="Fury"/> and a decent amount of might. Exactly like the meta-counterpart it provides good offensive support via <Skill name="Bane Signet"/>, it is important to understand that the signet share is essential to faster runs and sharing extra power during <Effect name="Exposed"/> (broken Defiance bar). The main source of <Boon name="Quickness"/> is <Skill name="Restoring Reprieve"/> and <Skill name="Potent Haste"/>; <Skill name="Feel My Wrath"/> is optional.

The <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> heals with any symbols, dodges, <Boon name="Regeneration"/>, <Skill name="Restoring Reprieve"/>, and if necessary <Skill name="Bow of Truth"/>. If your group is unable to stay alive, you can swap out your offensive support (<Skill name="Bane Signet"/> and radiance) to virtues for more heals, *but* it should not be needed.

When <Instability name="Afflicted"/> is present or enemies are applying conditions, you can use <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/> (Staff3) and blast it with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> (Staff2) for area condition cleanse.


If you play this build we highly recommend learning the <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> share variant. If you want a good and smooth run, take a look at the [Fractal Pages](/fractals). This class will not be doing much damage but understanding how the class works best and when to do <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> sharing is important!

<Card specialization="Renegade" title="Heal Renegade">
| Build | Synergy | DPS | Independence | Basics | Mastery | 
| ---- | --------- | -- | ------------| ------ | ------- |
| [<Specialization name="Renegade" disableLink />](/builds/revenant/heal-renegade) | <Rating value="4"/> | <Rating value="1"/> | <Rating value="3"/> | <Rating value="2"/> | <Rating value="2"/> | 

The **<Specialization text="Heal Renegade" name="Renegade"/>** plays with a mix of harrier's and cleric's gear for maximum power and healing power while still hitting 100% boon duration.
 
Since the damage and life steals of <Skill name="Soulcleaves Summit" /> are based on the **<Specialization text="Heal Renegade" name="Renegade"/>**'s own power and healing power, the <Specialization text="Heal Renegade" name="Renegade"/> aims to maximize those stats.

Feel free to run full Harrier if you are confident that you don't need the extra healing power or toughness from cleric. The more agony resistance you have, the more cleric you can afford to run and still hit 100% boon duration.
