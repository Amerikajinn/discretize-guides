### Basics of Crowd Control<br/>:
<Grid>
<GridItem sm="6">

What is the Defiance bar?

The Defiance bar is a very important mechanic that lets players do more damage to a mob for a certain amount of time after breaking it. Some enemies, often elite or higher have this mechanic and the goal is to break this bar as fast as possible, making the mob unable to attack and gets an effect named <Effect name="exposed"/>. The Defiance bar's value varies from boss to boss and between mobs too, what matters is that you should break it.

<GridItem sm="6">
What does CC mean?

CC is an acronym for Crowd Control, this includes soft CC and hard CC.

**Soft CC** skills are applied by conditions, they inflict damage to the Defiance bar **over time**. In comparison to that **hard CC** removes defiance bar **instantaneously**. Since you want to get the <Effect name="exposed"/> effect as soon as possible you can't rely on soft CC breaking a bar of 2000.

Crowd Control is key
</GridItem>
<GridItem sm="6">
This guide's aim is to help you how your team should contribute to breaking this bar with CC (Crowd Control, will be referred as CC from now on). The present <Specialization name="firebrand"/> + <Specialization name="renegade"/> meta demands CC contributions from every member of the party, even of the DPS players. The amount of CC a skill does is listed in the respective build pages.  

In Tier 4 fractals (T4) a breakbar usually does not exceed 600. Nevertheless it is everyone's responsibility to break bars as quickly as possible. In PuG (Pick up Group, players from the LFG system) runs, where you can rely on the fact that 4 out of 5 people did not read this page it is very much recommended to make up for the lack of CC with [CC consumables](/guides/consumables).

**A fast break will decrease kill times by a large margin even if your party underperforms in every other aspect!**

## Challenge Mode CC distribution
<Tabs>

<Tab title="Mama">
<Divider text="MAMA restricted"/>

At 1800 MAMA has a small defiance bar, but you need to break it three times during the fight. In combination with the Knights that have defiance bars of 800 each MAMA becomes the most CC heavy fractal boss in the game.  
When playing without CC Consumables, the <Specialization name="Berserker"/> needs to take double maces in addition to <Skill name="wildblow"/> and the <Specialization name="firebrand"/> needs to bring <Skill name="HammerofWisdom"/> instead of <Skill name="sword of justice"/>.

<Divider text="MAMA unrestricted"/>
When playing with CC consumables, the <Specialization name="Berserker"/> can take only an off-hand mace and the <Specialization name="firebrand"/> can keep <Skill name="sword of justice"/>.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Siax">
<Divider text="Siax"/>
At 2000 Siax has a medium-sized defiance bar that you should only have to break once if you are fast.  
Use a <Item name="metalrod"/> if you don't trust your group.
<Image src="./images/siax.png" caption="Siax CC distribution"/>

</Tab>
<Tab title="Ensolyss">
<Divider text="Ensolyss"/>
At 2000 in the first phase, and ~2250 in the second and third phase, Ensolyss has sizeable defiance bars that need to be broken fast to avoid time loss in the first phase and taking damage in the second and third phase. 
The small time window for breaking the first bar means that everyone in the party **must** contribute. 
The bigger bar in the second and third phase means that the <Specialization name="Berserker"/>  needs to do an extra <Skill name="pommelbash"/> and that the weaver needs to do an extra <Skill name="polaricleap"/>.  
Check the [Berserker guide](/builds/warrior/banner-berserker) for more information on traits, utility skills and weapons.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Skorvald">
<Divider text="Skorvald"/>
At 2200 Skorvald the Shattered has one of the largest defiance bars out of all the Challenge Mode fractal bosses, meaning that the whole group needs to contribute to break it quickly.  
<Specialization name="berserker"/> can forgo Mace off-hand in favor of a warhorn (with a paralyzation sigil) for blasting <Boon name="Might"/> on the islands if the <Specialization name="renegade"/> precasts <Skill name="Darkrazorsdaring"/> and has decent positioning, getting 5 hits of <Skill name="Surge of the mists"/>.

<Image src="./images/skorvald.png" caption="Skorvald CC distribution"/>
</Tab>
<Tab title="Artsariiv">
<Divider text="Artsariiv"/>
At 2100 Artsariiv has a large defiance bar that needs to be broken quickly for the <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> to land their reflect into <Effect name="exposed"/>. Luckily you have the special Action Key working in your favour, which the <Specialization name="renegade"/> should utilize by canceling his <Skill name="Surge of the mists"/> with it, causing it to hit 9 times, resulting in 1350 defiance bar damage.  
This properties of the special action key can be used to get more hits with any movement skills, like warrior's <Skill name="whirlwindattack"/> (Greatsword 3) and Fiery Greatsword's <Skill name="fierywhirl"/>. (3).  
The remaining 750 defiance bar damage should come from the <Specialization name="firebrand"/>'s <Skill name="Banesignet"/> and from <Specialization name="berserker"/>'s <Skill name="headbutt"/> and either <Skill name="Tremor"/> or <Skill name="updraft"/> from <Specialization name="weaver"/> if the <Specialization name="berserker"/> isn't bringing Mace off-hand.

### Split phase adds
The easiest way to break the defiance bars on the split phase clones is with [crowd control consumables](/guides/consumables).  
The recommended way to break the first split phase clones is 1 <Item name="rock"/> and 1 <Item name="termiteshovel"/> or <Item name="metalrod"/>.  
The recommended way to break the second split phase clones is 1 <Item name="sentinelrifle"/> or 2 <Item name="rock"/> or a <Item name="termiteshovel">.
</Tab>

<Tab title="Arkk">
<Divider text="Arkk"/>
At 1800 Arkk has a small defiance bar that appears after the Bloom pushing phase at 80%, 50% and 30%.  
But again you have the Special Action Key working in your favor, which in addition to causing <Skill name="Surge of the mists"/> to hit 9 times, the Launch from the Special Action Key will also double-hit, bringing the <Specialization name="renegade"/>'s defiance bar damage up to 1814.  
The only reason the <Specialization name="berserker"/> carries an off-hand mace on Arkk is to get the <Item name="severance"/> buff by precasting <Skill name="Tremor"/> after each Bloom phase.
