## Team Composition

The current "meta" group setup for fractals consists of the following builds:

| <Specialization name="renegade" text="Heal Renegade"/> | The *<Specialization text="Heal Renegade" name="renegade"/>*'s role is to provide 100% <Boon name="alacrity"/> uptime, and some <Boon name="might"/> uptime, strong utilities in terms of heavy crowd control, <Skill name="Soulcleaves Summit"/> for extra team DPS and low to medium power DPS. <Specialization text="Heal Renegade" name="renegade"/> has strong party heals with <Skill name="Soulcleaves Summit"/> and <Skill name="Breakrazors Bastion"/>, condi cleanse and further heals with <Skill name="Legendary Centaur stance"/>. It can also give <Boon name="stability"/> where needed with <Skill name="Legendary Dwarf stance"/>. If <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/> or <Instability name="Vengeance"/> instability is present use <Skill name="Banish Enchantment"/> (<Skill name="Legendary Demon stance"/>) to strip boons. |
| <Specialization name="firebrand"/> | The <Specialization text="Hybrid Firebrand" name="firebrand"/>'s role consists of providing 100% <Boon name="quickness"/> uptime, utilities in terms of crowd control, reflects, shared <Boon name="aegis"/> and medium power DPS. It can even provide <Boon name="resistance"/> for a short time. **<Specialization text="Heal Firebrand" name="firebrand"/> is only worth taking over <Specialization text="Heal Renegade" name="renegade"/> if your group needs perma heals. (not knowing mechanics and permadowning).**  |
| <Specialization name="warrior" text="Banner Warrior"/> | The <Specialization name="warrior" text="Banner Warrior"/> is still essential to any team, providing strong party buffs in the form of <Skill id="14405" profession="warrior"/>, <Skill id="14407" profession="warrior"/> and <Trait id="1482" profession="warrior"/>. The currently favored build is the <Specialization text="Banner Warrior" name="warrior"/> with immense CC capabilities, can keep up x25 <Boon name="might"/>, give <Boon name="fury"/> with <Skill name="For Great Justice"/> and has good burst DPS. <Specialization name="berserker" text="Banner Berserker"/> is a risky pick here, since you do not know other's CC capabilities. **<Specialization name="spellbreaker"/> is not used in this comp, only in some T4 encounters like Molten Boss Effigy and Twilight Oasis last boss Amala.**                                       |
| <Specialization name="weaver"/>       | The <Specialization text="Power Sword Weaver" name="weaver"/> is one of the typical damage dealers. Its main purpose is to deal as much damage as possible while providing minor utilities with AoE <Condition name="blind"/>, <Skill id="5536" profession="elementalist"/> and <Boon name="might"/> pre-stacking.) .                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| <Specialization name="dragonhunter"/> | The <Specialization text="Power Dragonhunter" name="dragonhunter"/> is the second most sought after damage dealer. It's great for fight where the instabilities would kill weaver easily. Safer option and still has great dps. Pick <Specialization name="dragonhunter"/> over <Specialization name="weaver"/> if the instabilities are unbearable. |
|  <Specialization name="soulbeast"/>    | The <Specialization text="Power Soulbeast" name="soulbeast"/> takes the 2nd DPS's place in the party, buffs the group's damage output with <Skill id="12497" profession="ranger"/> while also providing extra CC. If additional condition cleanse or a group damage boost is valuable (e.g. Molten Effigy Event in Molten Boss fractal), <Trait id="2128"/>, can be taken instead of <Trait id="2143"/>.                                                                                                                                          |

| <Specialization name="berserker" text="Banner Berserker"/> | The <Specialization text="Banner Berserker" name="berserker"/> is the strongest build for <Specialization name="warrior"/> in fractals, essential to any team, providing party buffs in the form of <Skill id="14405" profession="warrior"/>, <Skill id="14407" profession="warrior"/>. Furthermore, it has excellent single defiance bar damage in <Skill name="Tremor"/> and <Skill name="Headbutt"/>, the build also has relatively high burst and excellent sustained damage.

While condition-based team setups are perfectly viable, power setups tend to outperform them in fractals due to <Item id="24868"/> and Slaying Potions like <Item id="50082"/>. Fights are also shorter than in raids and power classes usually benefit more from the additional precision from the <Item id="79722"/>.

## Usage of `/gg`

<Grid>
<GridItem sm="8">
You can use the chat command `/gg` within fractals to immediately kill your character (dead, not downed). This can be used generously in fractal skips, as it allows the entire party to teleport to a checkpoint once one player activates it.

If everyone in the party is dead at the same time, cooldowns will reset for all players. Therefore it is advised for the entire group to use `/gg` at certain key positions to reset long cooldowns, like between Siax (2nd boss) and Ensolyss (3rd boss) in 99CM. Never resurrect as long as another player is still alive.

Note that the <Specialization name="druid"/>'s <Skill id="31869"/> and <Skill name="Reapers Shroud"/> for <Specialization name="reaper"/> will fully recharge after the resurrection.

## Mistlock Instabilities

Tier 4 fractals always have three Mistlock Instabilities active which add additional mechanics to the fights. The selection is fixed for each difficulty level and specified in the top panel of each fractal guide.

Below is a list of all current instabilities and their possible countermeasures.

|                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <Instability name="Adrenaline Rush"/>     | When enraged, enemies deal 150% increased damage while they're low on health. Enemies deal 20% less damage when not enraged.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| <Instability name="Afflicted"/>           | Outgoing <Boon name="resistance"/> duration is increased by 50%. Enemies apply random conditions. (<Condition name="bleeding"/>, <Condition name="burning"/>, <Condition name="confusion"/>, <Condition name="poison"/> and <Condition name="torment"/>). Not necessary, although a good countermeasure is to have the <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> use <Skill id="45460"/> or blasting light fields.  |
| <Instability name="Flux Bomb"/>           |  This means that players in combat are randomly marked with Flux Bombs which leave a damaging and blinding AoE field behind. Do not place those inside the combat area, learn to dash away right before the field deploys. If you keep walking forward while marked you wont get any damage from the bomb. Flux bombs now apply to both allies and enemies. ***It is a little dps increase to deploy into the boss/mob but it is not worth it most of the times !***                                    |
| <Instability name="Last Laugh"/>          | Enemies explode upon dying if not stunned. Stunned enemies apply protection and stability to nearby players. Each enemy killed explodes within a 180 radius 1.75 seconds after its death, dealing high damage and apply <Control name="daze"/> to foes around it. Recognizable by a yellow zone after a mob's death. Stunned enemies apply <Boon name="protection"/> and <Boon name="stability"/> to nearby players.                                                                                                                               |
| <Instability name="Mists Convergence"/>   | Causes a set of effects from other fractals to spawn, including _The Mossman_, a deadly _Champion Rabbit_, _Veteran Jade Maw Tentacles_, an _air strike_ from the PvP map Skyhammer and the _cannon assault_ from Captain Mai Trin Fractal.                                                                                           |
| <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/>    | Enemies receive <Boon name="protection"/>, <Boon name="might"/> and <Boon name="fury"/> when you hit them. Has a 20 second internal cooldown per enemy,  <Specialization text="Hybrid Chronomancer" name="chronomancer"/> can strip the boons using <Trait name="Shattered Concentration"/> trait or <Specialization text="Hybrid Renegade" name="renegade"/> with <Skill name="Banish Enchantment"/> (<Skill name="Legendary Demon stance"/>). Stripping an enemy boon will steal their life.                                                                                                                |
| <Instability name="Social Awkwardness"/>  | Players will be pushed away from one another. |
| <Instability name="Toxic Trail"/>         | Enemies leave a trail of poison behind them which inflicts direct damage and the <Condition name="poison"/> condition. Blocking a toxic-trail attack will absorb it and cleanse the condition. Can be very dangerous when fighting multiple mobs.                                                                                                                                                             |
| <Instability name="Fractal Vindicators"/> | Fractal Avengers are replaced by hard-hitting Fractal Vindicators. Those need to be killed as fast as possible to prevent further chaos.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| <Instability name="Hamstrung"/>           | The lower your health, the slower you move. Endurance regenerates 33% faster. Heal yourself to reduce Hamstrung stacks!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| <Instability name="Boon overload"/> | Each boon on a player increases incoming strike damage by 5%. Outgoing boon duration is increased by 20%.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| <Instability name="Frailty"/> | Players are smaller and have 30% less health, but they move 25% faster.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| <Instability name="We Bleed Fire"/> | Enemies create flaming missiles when damaged. Incoming condition damage is reduced by 20%. Can be reflected for extra damage.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| <Instability name="Vengeance"/> | When enemies die, they enhance nearby foes with multiple boons, it does not apply to elite foes. Strip any enemy boon to inflict them with weakness.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| <Instability name="Outflanked"/> | Foes within 300 range do 300% more damage when attacking from behind, but do 25% less damage to you (their damage is reduced to 75%) when attacking from ahead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| <Instability name="Stick Together"/> | 	Take 60% increased damage when not within a range of 300 of an ally. Take 20% reduced damage when within a range of 300 of an ally.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
