## Team Composition

The current "meta" group setup for fractals consists of the following builds:

| <Specialization name="chronomancer"/> | The Chronomancer's role consists of providing 100% <Boon name="quickness"/> uptime, good <Boon name="alacrity"/> uptime, strong utilities in terms of heavy crowd control, reflects, shared <Boon name="aegis"/>, <Skill id="10197" profession="mesmer"/> skips, group <Effect name="stealth"/> and medium power DPS.

| <Specialization name="warrior"/> | The Warrior is still essential to any team, providing strong party buffs in the form of <Skill id="14405" profession="warrior"/>, <Skill id="14407" profession="warrior"/> and <Trait id="1482" profession="warrior"/>. The currently favored build is the <Specialization text="Banner Warrior" name="warrior"/> with immense CC capabilities and good burst DPS. Spellbreaker is only used for <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/>, boon heavy fractals and projectile destruction. |
| <Specialization name="weaver"/> | The Weaver is one of the typical damage dealers. Its main purpose is to deal as much damage as possible while providing minor utilities with AoE <Condition name="blind"/>, <Skill id="5536" profession="elementalist"/> and <Boon name="might"/> pre-stacking.) |
| <Specialization name="dragonhunter"/> | The Dragonhunter is the second most sought after damage dealer. It's great for fight where the instabilities would kill weaver easily. Safer option and still has great dps. |
| <Specialization name="druid"/> | The Druid significantly buffs the group's damage output with <Skill id="12493" profession="ranger"/>, <Skill id="12497" profession="ranger"/>, <Skill id="31582" profession="ranger"/>, 25x <Boon name="might"/>, <Boon name="fury"/> and <Trait id="1016" profession="ranger"/> while also providing party heals and condition cleanses. If required, it can even provide permanent <Boon name="protection"/> and <Boon name="stability"/> when needed.

|  <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/>    | The Power Soulbeast takes over the Druid's or 3rd DPS's place in the party, buffs the group's damage output with <Skill id="12497" profession="ranger"/> while also providing extra CC. If additional condition cleanse or a group damage boost is valuable (e.g. Molten Effigy Event in Molten Boss fractal), <Trait id="2128"/>, can be taken instead of <Trait id="2143"/>.                                                                                                                                          |

The only interchangeable slots in the prevailing team composition depends on whether you are using a Druid or not:

- with Druid, both DPS slots can be filled with any DPS
- without Druid, Elementalists (or other might-generating builds) are required to keep up 25 stacks of <Boon name="Might"/>

While condition-based team setups are perfectly viable, power setups tend to outperform them in fractals due to <Item id="24868"/> and Slaying Potions like <Item id="50082"/>. Fights are also shorter than in raids and power classes usually benefit more from the additional precision from the <Item id="79722"/>.

## Usage of `/gg`

<Grid>
<GridItem sm="8">
You can use the chat command `/gg` within fractals to immediately kill your character (dead, not downed). This can be used generously in fractal skips, as it allows the entire party to teleport to a checkpoint once one player activates it.
If everyone in the party is dead at the same time, cooldowns will reset for all players. Therefore it is advised for the entire group to use `/gg` at certain key positions to reset long cooldowns, like between Siax (2nd boss) and Ensolyss (3rd boss) in 99CM. Never resurrect as long as another player is still alive.

Note that the Druid's <Skill id="31869"/> will fully recharge after the resurrection.

## Mistlock Instabilities

Tier 4 fractals always have three Mistlock Instabilities active which add additional mechanics to the fights. The selection is fixed for each difficulty level and specified in the top panel of each fractal guide.

Below is a list of all current instabilities and their possible countermeasures.

|                                           |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <Instability name="Adrenaline Rush"/>     | When enraged, enemies deal 150% increased damage while they're low on health. Enemies deal 20% less damage when not enraged.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| <Instability name="Afflicted"/>           | Outgoing <Boon name="resistance"/> duration is increased by 50%. Enemies apply random conditions. (<Condition name="bleeding"/>, <Condition name="burning"/>, <Condition name="confusion"/>, <Condition name="poison"/> and <Condition name="torment"/>). Not necessary, although a good countermeasure is to have the <Specialization name="druid"/> use <Skill id="12489"/> in combination with <Trait id="1075"/>.  |
| <Instability name="Flux Bomb"/>           |  This means that players in combat are randomly marked with Flux Bombs which leave a damaging and blinding AoE field behind. Do not place those inside the combat area, learn to dash away right before the field deploys. If you keep walking forward while marked you wont get any damage from the bomb. Flux bombs now apply to both allies and enemies. ***It is a little dps increase to deploy into the boss/mob but it is not worth it most of the times !***                                    |
| <Instability name="Last Laugh"/>          | Enemies explode upon dying if not stunned. Stunned enemies apply protection and stability to nearby players. Each enemy killed explodes within a 180 radius 1.75 seconds after its death, dealing high damage and apply <Control name="daze"/> to foes around it. Recognizable by a yellow zone after a mob's death. Stunned enemies apply <Boon name="protection"/> and <Boon name="stability"/> to nearby players.                                                                                                                               |
| <Instability name="Mists Convergence"/>   | Causes a set of effects from other fractals to spawn, including _The Mossman_, a deadly _Champion Rabbit_, _Veteran Jade Maw Tentacles_, an _air strike_ from the PvP map Skyhammer and the _cannon assault_ from Captain Mai Trin Fractal.                                                                                           |
| <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/>    | Enemies receive <Boon name="protection"/>, <Boon name="might"/> and <Boon name="fury"/> when you hit them. Has a 20 second internal cooldown per enemy, conveniently lining up with the Mesmer's <Skill id="10267"/>. Stripping an enemy boon will steal their life.                                                                                                                |
| <Instability name="Social Awkwardness"/>  | Players will be pushed away from one another. |
| <Instability name="Toxic Trail"/>         | Enemies leave a trail of poison behind them which inflicts direct damage and the <Condition name="poison"/> condition. Blocking a toxic-trail attack will absorb it and cleanse the condition. Can be very dangerous when fighting multiple mobs.                                                                                                                                                             |
| <Instability name="Fractal Vindicators"/> | Fractal Avengers are replaced by hard-hitting Fractal Vindicators. Those need to be killed as fast as possible to prevent further chaos.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| <Instability name="Hamstrung"/>           | The lower your health, the slower you move. Endurance regenerates 33% faster. Heal yourself to reduce Hamstrung stacks!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| <Instability name="Boon overload"/> | Each boon on a player increases incoming strike damage by 5%. Outgoing boon duration is increased by 20%.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| <Instability name="Frailty"/> | Players are smaller and have 30% less health, but they move 25% faster.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| <Instability name="We Bleed Fire"/> | Enemies create flaming missiles when damaged. Incoming condition damage is reduced by 20%.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| <Instability name="Vengeance"/> | When enemies die, they enhance nearby foes with multiple boons, it does not apply to elite foes. Strip any enemy boon to inflict them with weakness.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| <Instability name="Outflanked"/> | Foes within 300 range do 300% more damage when attacking from behind, but do 25% less damage to you (their damage is reduced to 75%) when attacking from ahead.                                                                                                                                           |
| <Instability name="Slippery Slope"/> | All surfaces are slick. Outgoing <Boon name="stability"/> duration is increased by 20%.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| <Instability name="Birds"/> | 	Birds of prey periodically assault players. Dodging transfers the birds to nearby enemies for 4 seconds.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
