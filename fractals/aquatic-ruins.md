## Dark Path
<Grid>
<Column>
Swim together and take the *Luminous Plants* on the way to protect you and nearby players from dying. If you are able to survive it, take the shortcut to the left after entering the larger cave. Use dodges or <Effect name="invulnerability"/> for the last group of Krait. If someone reaches the end boss, use <Command name="gg"/> to immediately resurrect there.

## *or* Dolphin Path
Spam Skill 1 during swimming to reveal nearby hidden Krait and keep to the right. You can use Skill 2 to create a distraction and Skill 3 to get a short speed boost. Skill 5 can be used to instantly revive nearby dead allies. Always dodge **twice** when you anticipate a Krait attack. As soon as someone reaches the end boss, use <Command name="gg"/> to immediately resurrect there.
