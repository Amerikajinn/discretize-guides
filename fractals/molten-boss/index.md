## Molten Effigy
Due to good game design, this boss is immune to <Condition name="burning"/> (*clap*) which renders most condition-based classes useless (like Condition Berserker or Condition Firebrand). Use interrupts or reflects against the *Firestorm* attack and kill the spawning group of mobs afterwards.

## Molten Berserker & Molten Firestorm
When you walk onto the end boss area, a group-wide <Effect name="agony"/> effect will be applied and put you in combat. As soon as it ends, use any Notice like <Item id="78786"/> to bypass the cutscene.    
Thanks to the item you can continue to walk and use skills, though the camera is a bit messy. Use the gained time to stack <Boon name="might"/>.

Kill the *Molten Berserker* first and pay attention to the AoEs and triple shockwave attack. Reflects are useful here as well. The *Molten Firestorm* will heal to full health after his comrade is dead, kill him afterwards to finish the fractal.    
Do not walk into the hitboxes of the two bosses to prevent them from moving into the outer, inaccessible area.
