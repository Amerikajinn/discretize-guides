## The way to the Molten Effigy
Since the 2017. november 28th patch, this fractal has been reworked and now you have to walk alot, skipping the groups of mobs on your way. When u reach the first path block (a firewall maintained by the Elite Smoke Shaman). Kill the Shaman to destroy the firewall blocking the way, then progress to the next Elite Flame Shaman, he is <Effect name="invulnerability"/> until you kill the Resonator it is connected to, then he gains a breakbar, break it, kill him. Stack <Boon name="might"/> on the bridge and move on to the Effigy.

## Molten Effigy
Since the 2017. november 28th patch, this boss is not immune to <Condition name="burning"/> anymore.  Use interrupts or reflects against the *Firestorm* attack and cleave the group of mobs around it. The moment you killed the Effigy, you can move on to the next two Elites, kill them and the steam blocking the path is no longer there. Kill the group of mobs before the gate to open it, then kill the 6 mob before the boss platform to move the bridge up. Get into the arena, then use `/gg` to reset cooldowns, walk into the arena again.

## Molten Berserker & Molten Firestorm
When you walk onto the end boss area, a group-wide <Effect name="agony"/> effect will be applied and put you in combat. As soon as it ends, use the small time before boss starts to stack <Boon name="might"/>.

Kill the *Molten Berserker* first and pay attention to the AoEs and triple shockwave attack. Reflects are useful here as well. The *Molten Firestorm* will heal to full health after his comrade is dead, kill him afterwards to finish the fractal.    
Do not walk into the hitboxes of the two bosses to prevent them from moving into the outer, inaccessible area.    
Note that since the rework, you are no longer knocked on the outside ring of the arena (resonating part), it simply works as a soft pull towards the edge, to push you off. If needed you can go to the boss outside of the safe zone to kill, just make sure to always move inwards the arena and dodge the *Molten Firestorm*'s knockback AoE (big orange circle) so you do not fall off.
