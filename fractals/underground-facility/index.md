## Locked Gates
<Grid>
<Column>

| --- | --- |
| **Preparation** | The best way - as usual - is to stack <Effect name="stealth"/> on the platform before jumping down and not killing a single mob. Clarify this before running ahead and assign people for the roles below.<br/>The first button grants access to the second button, the second button grants access to the console room and the two buttons in the console room grant access to the console locker. A player needs about 20 seconds to activate the final console without interruption. |
| **The First Button** | The best option for this is a Mesmer who teleports up from the ground floor [as seen here](https://youtu.be/jQCKegeS3DI) and gives party <Effect name="stealth"/> from above.<br/>Otherwise let the most 'useless' class walk up with a little head start (usually the Warrior).<br/>The rest of the party should keep <Effect name="stealth"/> up and run through the open gate immediately. |
| **The Second Button** | This is usually done by an Elementalist who teleports up from below while the others keep up <Effect name="stealth"/>.<br/>Other options are Thief or Mesmer who can even come back easily for the Console room using <Skill id="13106"/> or <Skill id="10197"/> respectively.<br/>*New:* Activating the second button once now permanently opens the first door. |
| **The Console Room** | Two people without special abilities should step on the two buttons to open the console locker. They are also responsible for keeping aggro from the opener, especially the spawning *Veteran Dredge* next to the locker.<br/>Now for the actual console, <Item id="8686"/> and other <Effect name="stealth"/> sources are very strong. It should be activated by someone who's able to block the <Control name="knockback"/> from the locker closing, so the other two people can step off the buttons and protect the opener from the spawning mobs. The opener should indicate the step off in chat to trigger the <Control name="knockback"/> and time it with block skills.<br/>**The whole party does <Command name="gg"/> after the console is done**, everyone will be resurrected upstairs.

## Guns *or* Bombs path
<Grid>
<Column>
After resurrecting, skip the mobs with <Effect name="stealth"/> and either use three guns four times or nine bombs to destroy the gate.    
On the guns path, any equipped gun near the door will break when the door reaches 75%/50%/25% health.    
On the bombs path, be sure to take the *Concealing Dust* at the begin **and** at the end to permanently keep <Effect name="stealth"/> up on yourself.

<Tips>
    <Tip specialization="chronomancer">Immediately cast <Skill id="10245"/> twice with <Skill id="29830"/> to skip past the mobs after resurrecting. Use <Skill id="29578"/> with <Skill id="10197"/> to quickly port back to the Bombs/Guns.<br/>**Note that teleporting while carrying a Gun or Bomb does not work.**</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="thief">Cast <Skill id="13117"/> for immediate <Effect name="stealth"/>.</Tip>

## Champion Rabsovich
When you destroy the door, you will reach the most annoying boss ingame. There's really no trick with him apart from breaking his defiance bar as often as possible. If needed, do <Command name="gg"/> afterwards to reset your wasted cooldowns.

## Dredge Powersuit *or* Rampaging Ice Elemental
<Grid>
<Column>
You can either stack <Effect name="stealth"/> and skip towards the Endboss together or let the Mesmer teleport ahead and do a <Skill id="10197"/>. In the latter case, <Command name="gg"/> after placing the portal and take it together. Keep in mind the maximum range.

After loosing potential aggro of the mobs from the corridor, pull the boss to the next lava bucket, trigger it to inflict *Superheated* for 10x damage and nuke. Stay on the boss as long as possible before moving to the next bucket but pay attention to his *Mending* heal skill, which can be interrupted by simply attacking him as long as the Superheated debuff is up.    
The most deadly skills here are the *Bombs* from the Dredge Powersuit (they spawn slightly away from him) and *Shatterstone* (dropping ice shards on every player) and *Freeze Row* from the Ice Elemental (small delayed Ice-AoEs in a V-Shape which explode after 2.75s - unblockable).

<Tips>
    <Tip specialization="chronomancer">Take <Skill id="29526"/> against the Dredge Powersuit boss. Otherwise time your party invulnerables for key attacks like *Freeze Row*.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="thief">Teleport to the lava buckets from below with <Skill id="13025"/>.</Tip>
