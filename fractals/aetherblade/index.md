## Lasers <Item id="50082" text="false"/>
After the door opens, you enter a large area with two deathly laser puzzles.

The first one consists of a *moving laser square pattern* and can be disabled by activating four consoles inside a small room at the end of it. Pressing a console applies <Condition name="immobile"/> to you.

The second area is filled with *spinning lasers*. In exactly the same way as before, four consoles around the area have to be activated to disable the traps.

There are two options for completing the area:

**Option 1:** Someone (usually an <Specialization name="elementalist"/>) teleports up to the first console room and disables the four consoles using condition cleanses. Meanwhile, the <Specialization name="mesmer"/> places a portal at the ground level, teleports two times to the second level and opens the portal for the remaining party.    
If you are fast enough, you can disable the consoles in the second room together before the spinning lasers become active.

**Option 2 (recommended):** Everyone except the console activator does `/gg`. The activator teleports to the first level and activates the four consoles, then he does `/gg` too. The party resurrects directly on the way up to the second level and activates the second set of consoles before the spinning lasers become active.

<Tips>
    <Tip specialization="mesmer">Use <Skill id="29578"/>, <Skill id="10200"/> and <Skill id="10197"/> to teleport everyone up to the second level. Cast <Skill id="30305"/> or any Shatter skill with <Trait id="740"/> to remove <Condition name="immobile"/>.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="elementalist">Teleport up to the first level with <Skill id="5536"/> and cast <Skill id="5507"/> to periodically clear <Condition name="immobile"/> while activating the four consoles.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="daredevil">You can solo both the first and second room if you are fast enough. Use <Skill id="13002"/> or <Skill id="13025"/> to teleport and <Trait id="1964"/> or <Skill id="13062"/> as condition clears.</Tip>

## <Boss red/> Final room (Frizz) <Item id="8887" text="false"/>
<Grid>
<Column>
Talk to *Inspector Ellen Kiel* to teleport your party into the final room. Stack <Boon name="might"/> as soon as you are in.

Initially, there are Frizz and two Inquest enemies to fight. As soon as Frizz reaches 75%, he teleports to the middle and becomes invulnerable.

After about five seconds, the first *Aetherblade Golem* wakes up and two *Small Lasers* start spinning. You can jump over the small lasers by utilizing the elevated boxes around.

When the first golem dies, the two *Small Lasers* will disappear and two more *Aetherblade Golems* wake up. *Large Lasers* start spinning which you cannot bypass without <Effect name="invulnerability"/>.

As soon as the two golems are dead, the two *Small Lasers* will join the two large lasers again and two final golems wake up. Kill those to finish the fight.

If a golem walks through a laser, he powers up and blocks all attacks for a short time. Pay attention to their <Control name="pull"/> attack, though it should not be a problem with high damage.
