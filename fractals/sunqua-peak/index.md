The Sunqua Peak fractal is different from previously released fractals: After doing all the achievements a challange mote is unlocked which opens a portal to the last boss. The bosses in normal mode are supposed to teach the mechanics of the endboss. 

## First jumping puzzle 
Killing elementals spawns lightning strikes that periodically leave behind a sword like item. Upon collection it grants the temporary buff <Uncategorized name="chargedleap"/> that enhances the jumping height. Since it stacks up to 3 times it is recommended to collect 1-3 to ease the jumping part. After approaching the platform with the *Mistlock Singularity*, jump over to the boss via the buggy updraft to set a checkpoint for possibly left behind team mates. `/gg` and preboon <Boon name="Might"/>, <Boon name="Quickness"/> and <Boon name="Alacrity"/> on the *Mistlock Singularity*.


## Voice of the mountain <Label>xx HP</Label>

<Grid>
<GridItem sm="7">
Voice of the mountain is the first boss in eventually Sunqua Peak fractal. Regardless of running with or without healer, this boss deals very little damage. Try to avoid AoEs. Every 33% the boss gets <Effect name="Invulnerability"/> and lightning strikes are starting. Again, they leave collectable items for the jump buff behind. Collect 2 or 3 of them and jump inside the white AoEs to collect the clouds in the air. Make sure to avoid any big red AoEs as they deal heavy damage.

## Water Path to the next boss

<Message>
Not a single trash mob needs to be killed for progression! 
</Message>

After the Voice of the mountain is dead, take the buggy updraft. Follow the path. In order to trigger the next boss all three Elemental clouds have to be freed by interacting with them. They spawn along the path and are not hidden. Right in the beginning there are water rifts that are buggy. <Boon name="Stability"/> does not prohibit the push down the cliff. Dodge through and pray to the gods of six you are not getting knocked down. The second waterfall can be easily skipped by walking behind it. 

Jump to the last boss, remember to free the elementals.

## Big stone of the mountain <Label>xx HP</Label>

<Grid>
<GridItem sm="8">
The second boss of the fractal is a big stone of the memes. Whoever is closest to the dark cloud on the side of the arena gets tethered to it and receives the debuff <Uncategorized name="tidalbargain"/> that increases over time. Before reaching 10 stacks another player should take the tether by running inside the visual connection and stay there for one second.

### Path two the next boss

There are little lava elementals blocking the way. Unfortunately there are stone piles blocking the way. Killing the lava elementals makes the piles magically disappear.

## Fury of the mountain <Label>xx HP</Label>

<Grid>
<GridItem sm="8">
The third boss of the fractal is a Fury of the mountain. Every 33% it gets <Effect name="Invulnerability"/> and spawns two AoEs with intensity circles. 

At 66% the rocks spawn in set positions, while in comparison at 33% two players get assigned an AoE that drops a meteor from the sky leaving a stone behind. Standing inside the circle puts <Condition name="Burning"/> on you and deals damage that scales with your distance to the epi center of the impact. The yellow dangerous looking tequatl shockwave does not deal any damage :omegalol:. 

After the shockwave roleplay is over the boss charges for a gigantic oneshotting attack. Seek shelter behind the meteors. 

Kill the boss and move on to the final encounter of this fractal.

## Sorrowful Spellcaster <Item id="50082" disableText/><Label>15,000,000 HP</Label>

This section explains CM and non-CM. The first part is for both the same, except that the Sorrowful Spellcaster has more HP and hits harder on CM. Mechanically it is the same.

### Part 1: Normal Form

<Grid>
<GridItem sm="8">
The Sorrowful Spellcaster is the fourth and final boss of the fractal. Unlike other fractal CM encounters prebooning does not work, because once you cross the green circle around the boss all boons will get removed. However, you can still precast unique buffs like <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> or <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/>. 

The boss has multiple phases themed around the different elements air, water, fire. The previously introduced mechanics are reoccuring.

#### Burn 1 <Label>100%-66%</Label>
After crossing the green line the fight starts. After about one second the spellcaster dashes to a randomly chosen side and becomes crowd control bar which should be broken as soon as possible to get the <Effect name="Exposed"/> buff. Ideally the group phases her in the corner, else she will repeat the attack pattern one more time. 

If you do not manage to bring her to 66% after the second side burn additional mechanics have to be done: collecting 2-3 <Uncategorized name="chargedleap"/> (depending on the height) to remove the clouds above the white AoEs. 

#### Meteor Phase <Label>66%-33%</Label>
After bringing the boss down to 66% it gets <Effect name="Invulnerability"/> and spawns meteor impact AoEs. Outrun them like a turtle (there is enough time even with roleplay walk). After the third set of impacts the boss reappears. Be aware, there is a fourth set of impacts encompassing 4 meteors covering the boss. Dodge this! Two players get assigned another meteor AoE that they should place in a non ideal team outside of the stack (in a coordinated team just ignore it by dodging at the right time). 

An AoE around the boss starts to expand launching a powerful attack that downs any ally, that did not seek shelter behind a rock. Be aware, there will only be one rock in CM. The rock that disappears is glowing red. 

After the rock attack the attack pattern from phase 1 repeats. After about a second the boss dashes to a randomly chosen side, a CC appears and you burst to 33%. 

### Water Phase <Label>33%-0%</Label>
The water phase starts at the entrance of the arena. After a short while a dark cloud appears which needs to be collected by a green AoE that appears around a player. The player closes to the cloud gets tethered to the it and receives the debuff <Uncategorized name="tidalbargain"/>.

Move counter clockwise and contiue removing the dark clouds with the green AoEs. During the fourth capture the boss dashes to the side and starts to cast powerful water tornado which deal heavy damage.
