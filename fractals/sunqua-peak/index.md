The Sunqua Peak fractal is different from previously released fractals: After doing all the achievements a challange mote is unlocked which opens a portal to the last boss. The bosses in normal mode are supposed to teach the mechanics of the endboss. 

## First jumping puzzle 
Killing elementals spawns lightning strikes that periodically leave behind a sword like item. Upon collection it grants a temporary buff that enhances the jumping height. Since it stacks it is recommended to collect 1-3 to ease the jumping part. After approaching the platform with the *Mistlock Singularity*, jump over to the boss via the buggy updraft to set a checkpoint for possibly left behind team mates. `/gg` and preboon <Boon name="Might"/>, <Boon name="Quickness"/> and <Boon name="Alacrity"/> on the *Mistlock Singularity*.


## Voice of the mountain <Label>xx HP</Label>

<Grid>
<GridItem sm="7">
Voice of the mountain is the first boss in eventually Sunqua Peak fractal. Regardless of running with or without healer, this boss deals very little damage. Try to avoid AoEs. Every 33% the boss becomes invulnerable and lightning strikes are starting. Again, they leave collectable items for the jump buff behind. Collect 2 or 3 of them and jump inside the white AoEs to collect the clouds in the air. Make sure to avoid any big red AoEs as they deal heavy damage.

## Water Path to the next boss

Not a single trash mob needs to be killed for progression! 
</Message>

After the Voice of the mountain is dead, take the buggy updraft. Follow the path. In order to trigger the next boss all three Elemental clouds have to be freed by interacting with them. They spawn along the path and are not hidden. Right in the beginning there are water rifts that are buggy. <Boon name="Stability"/> does not prohibit the push down the cliff. Dodge through and pray to the gods of six you are not getting knocked down. The second waterfall can be easily skipped by walking behind it. 

Jump to the last boss, remember to free the elementals.

## Big stone of the mountain <Label>xx HP</Label>

<Grid>
<GridItem sm="8">
The second boss of the fractal is a big stone of the memes. Whoever is closest to the dark cloud on the side of the arena gets tethered to it and receives a debuff that increases over time. Before reaching 10 stacks another player should take the tether by running inside the visual connection and stay there for one second.

### Path two the next boss

There are little lava elementals blocking the way. Unfortunately there are stone piles blocking the way. Killing the lava elementals makes the piles magically disappear.

## Fury of the mountain <Label>xx HP</Label>

<Grid>
<GridItem sm="8">
The third boss of the fractal is a Fury of the mountain. Every 33% it becomes invulnerable and spawns two AoEs with intensity circles. 

At 66% the rocks spawn in set positions, while in comparison at 33% two players get assigned an AoE that drops a meteor from the sky leaving a stone behind. Standing inside the circle puts <Condition name="Burning"/> on you and deals damage that scales with your distance to the epi center of the impact. The yellow dangerous looking tequatl shockwave does not deal any damage :omegalol:. 

After the shockwave roleplay is over the boss charges for a gigantic oneshotting attack. Seek shelter behind the meteors. 

Kill the boss and move on to the final encounter of this fractal.

This section explains CM and non-CM. The first part is for both the same, except that the Sorrowful Spellcaster has more HP and hits harder on CM. Mechanically it is the same.

### Part 1: Normal Form

<Grid>
<GridItem sm="8">
The Sorrowful Spellcaster is the fourth and final boss of the fractal. Unlike other fractal CM encounters prebooning does not work, because once you cross the green circle around the boss all boons will get removed. However, you can still precast unique buffs like <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> or <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/>. 

The boss has multiple phases themed around the different elements air, water, fire. The previously introduced mechanics are reoccuring.
