The Sunqua Peak fractal is different from previously released fractals: After doing all the achievements a Challange Mote is unlocked which opens a portal to the last boss in Challenge Mode. The bosses in normal mode are supposed to teach the mechanics of the endboss. 

## First jumping puzzle 
Killing elementals spawns lightning strikes that periodically leave behind a sword like item. Upon collection it grants the temporary buff <Uncategorized name="chargedleap"/> that enhances the jumping height. Since it stacks up to 3 times it is recommended to collect 1-3 to ease the jumping part. After approaching the platform with the *Mistlock Singularity*, jump over to the boss via the updraft to set a checkpoint for possibly left behind teammates. `/gg` and pre-stack boons like <Boon name="Might"/>, <Boon name="Quickness"/> and <Boon name="Alacrity"/> on the *Mistlock Singularity*.


## Voice of the mountain

<Grid>
<GridItem sm="7">
Voice of the mountain is the first boss in the fractal. Regardless of running with or without healer, this boss deals very little damage. Try to avoid AoEs. Every 33% the boss gets <Effect name="Invulnerability"/> and lightning strikes appread. They leave collectable items for <Uncategorized name="chargedleap"/>. Collect 3 of them and jump inside the white AoEs under the strom clouds to collect the orb in the clouds. Make sure to avoid any big red AoEs as they deal heavy damage.

### Water Path to the next boss

<Message>
Not a single trash mob needs to be killed for progression! 
</Message>

After the Voice of the mountain is dead, take the updraft. Follow the path. In order to trigger the next boss all three Elemental clouds have to be freed by interacting with them. They spawn along the path and are not hidden. Right in the beginning there are water rifts. <Boon name="Stability"/> does not prohibit getting pushed down the cliff. Dodge through. The second waterfall can be easily skipped by walking behind it. 

Do the mini jumping puzzle to the last boss, remember to free the elementals.

## Big stone of the mountain 

<Grid>
<GridItem sm="8">
The second boss of the fractal is a big pile of rocks. Whoever is closest to the dark cloud on the side of the arena gets tethered to it and receives the debuff <Uncategorized name="tidalbargain"/> that increases over time. Before reaching 10 stacks another player should take the tether by running inside the beam between the cloud and the tethered player and stay there for one second.

## Fury of the mountain 

<Grid>
<GridItem sm="8">
The third boss of the fractal is a Fury of the mountain. Every 33% it gets <Effect name="Invulnerability"/> and spawns two AoEs with intensity circles. 

At 66% the rocks spawn in set positions, while in comparison at 33% two players get assigned an AoE that drops a meteor from the sky leaving a stone behind. Standing inside the circle puts <Condition name="Burning"/> on you and deals damage that scales with your distance to the epicenter of the impact. The yellow shockwave does not deal any damage. 

After the shockwave is over the boss charges for a big attack that knocks you down into the lava. Seek shelter behind the meteors. 

Kill the boss and move on to the final encounter of this fractal.

## Sorrowful Spellcaster <Label>15,000,000 HP</Label>

This section explains CM and non-CM. The first part is for both the same, except that the Sorrowful Spellcaster has more HP and hits harder on CM. Mechanically it is the same. 
<Message>
When you break Ai's breakbar she gets a buff on her bar preventing a new breakbar from spawning for 30 seconds.

### Part 1: Normal Form <Label>Day</Label>

<Grid>
<GridItem sm="8">
The Sorrowful Spellcaster is the fourth and final boss of the fractal. Unlike other fractal CM encounters pre-booning does not work, because once you cross the green circle around the boss all boons will get removed. However, you can still precast unique buffs like <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> or <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/>. 

The boss has multiple phases themed around the different elements air, fire, water. The previously introduced mechanics are reoccuring.

</GridItem>
</Grid>

#### Air Phase <Label>100%-66%</Label>
After crossing the green line the fight starts. After about one second Ai dashes to a randomly chosen side and a CC bar appears which should be broken as soon as possible to get the <Effect name="Exposed"/> buff. Ideally the group phases her in the corner, else she will repeat the attack pattern one more time. 

If you do not manage to bring her to 66% after the second side burn additional mechanics have to be done: collecting 2-3 <Uncategorized name="chargedleap"/> (depending on the height) to remove the clouds above the white AoEs. 

#### Meteor Phase <Label>66%-33%</Label>
After bringing the boss down to 66% it gets <Effect name="Invulnerability"/> and spawns meteor impact AoEs. Outrun them like a turtle (there is enough time even with roleplay walk). After the third set of impacts the boss reappears. Be aware, there is a fourth set of impacts encompassing 4 meteors covering the boss. Dodge this! Two players get assigned another meteor AoE that they should place outside (in a non static team) of the stack (in a coordinated team just ignore it by dodging at the right time). 

An AoE around the boss starts to expand launching a powerful attack that downs any ally, that did not seek shelter behind a rock. Be aware, there will only be one rock in Challenge Mode. The rocks that disappear are glowing red before crumbling. 

After the meteor attack the attack pattern from phase 1 repeats. After about a second the boss dashes to a randomly chosen side, a CC bar appears and you burst to 33%. 

### Water Phase <Label>33%-0%</Label>
The water phase starts at the entrance of the arena. After a short while a dark cloud appears which needs to be collected by a green AoE that appears around a player. The player closes to the cloud gets tethered to the it and receives the debuff <Uncategorized name="tidalbargain"/>. You can take over the <Uncategorized name="tidalbargain"/> by standing inbetween the tethered person and the cloud.

Move counter clockwise and contiue removing the dark clouds with the green AoEs. During the fourth capture the boss dashes to the side and starts to cast powerful water tornado which deal heavy damage. 


### Part2: Laser disco <Label>Night</Label>
After a long roleplay Ai transforms into her demon form and the whole arena gets darker. This part of the phase does not have distinct phases like the first one but instead has checkpoints at 66% and 33% that when passed, adds new mechanics to the fight. 

#### Pre-Sorrow<Label>100%-66%</Label>
After recovering from being tethered by her Doubt the boss will initially dash in a random direction into the wall and start her attack pattern. Be careful to not stand in her dash path or to simply dodge through it as it deals heavy damage. Upon hitting the wall lasers will start to spawn in a set attack pattern that will be consistant throughout the fight this is also when the first breakbar appears which lasts 7 seconds. The hitboxes of the lasers are quite thin and it is therefore possible to stand inbetween two lasers and not get hit. After 5 waves of lasers Ai will dash again in a random direction towards a wall. This is when the first split phase will occur, a bunch of heavy ticking damage AoE's will spawn around the boss aswell as very large expanding circles around each players. Make sure to spread out to avoid heavy damage. She will then do a series of basic attacks before finally doing another split phase with a slightly different AoE pattern on the floor. 

She will keep dashing around the arena and mixing and matching her abilities described above until she dashes to the middle of the arena. The only difference with being in the middle of the arena is that during the split phase instead of pulsing AoE's, lasers appear that will converge once the player specific AoE's explode. Be careful when walking back into the boss as these lasers will converge on her in two waves and deal heavy damage.

From this point onward the boss will mostly stay in the center of the arena, dashing out only to instantly dash back in, or only staying on the wall for the 5 waves of laser attacks.

#### Sorrow<Label>66%-33%</Label>
<Message>
Any AoE's on the floor prior to her hitting 66% will still last the full duration so be careful when walking back to the center
</Message>
Upon hitting 66% the boss will stop any current animation and fizzle any current attack and dash towards the center of the arena. She will then instantly start channeling and pulsing out AoE's in a set ring pattern. Where the first ring is done, second is in the middle and third is far from the boss. However no AoE's will spawn directly next to the boss so staying in melee range is safe. There are also small safe zones between the AoE's.

At the same time a Sorrow will spawn, this mob will spawn at a random position inside the middle ring of AoE's, a few seconds after the boss begins channeling. You can tell where the Sorrow will spawn a few seconds before thanks to a small area of the arena lighting up at its eventual spawn location. The Sorrow will start channeling a devastating attack that will instantly down the whole party if it completes channeling. To prevent this the Sorrow must be killed or it's breakbar must be broken. Ranged CC such as <Skill name="Sanctuary"/> or <Skill name="Darkrazors Daring"/> is preferable as you get to stay inside the safe zone near the boss. Consumables such as <Item id="8678"/> are also very powerful due to their ranged nature.

At the same time as the Sorrow spawning 5 Fears will spawn on the perimeter of the arena and slowly start tracking the players and moving towards them. Getting touched by a fear will knock you down for a long period of time and apply moderate damage. 15 seconds after spawning the fears will explode dealing heavy AoE damage. Simply walk away from them and you will stay safe.

From this point onwards the fight is exactly as before, with the added mechanic that after each second split phase the boss will dash to a wall, instantly dash back and start her long channel that spawns a Sorrow. 

#### Guilt<Label>33%-0%</Label>
As before upon hitting 33% the boss will stop any current animation and fizzle any current attack and dash towards the center of the arena and start channeling. 

This part of the boss fight is exactly the same as the Sorrow part with one variation. Instead of spawning a Sorrow a Guilt will spawn. This Guilt will tether to a player and start applying stacks, this tether can be treated similarly to the tether seen in the water phase of Ai's normal form.

A few seconds after the Guilt spawns two Sorrows will spawn in addition, one on each side of the guilt. Both Sorrows need to be broken so ensure survival. From this point onward mechanics will constantly repeat until the boss is defeated.
