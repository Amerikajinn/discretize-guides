            <h4>Tactic</h4>
            <p>The key to the fight is fast crowd control, as breaking Skorvald's defiance bar prevents most of the mechanics. Immediately break it at the begin and bring him down to 66% health.    
At 66% and 33%, Skorvald becomes immune to damage and the party has to kill four *Elite Flux Anomalies* to proceed. They spawn on the islands in the Southwest, Southeast, Northeast and Northwest and have to be killed subsequently in that order - the party can use an air turbulence to travel between the islands. The Anomalies dont have much health (170k) but knock players back with shockwaves. Pay attention to the emotes and position yourself between the Anomaly and a wall.    
It is worth placing a <Item id="78978"/> portal on the main platform and opening it immediately after the 4th Anomaly is dead to deal more damage to Skorvald before he continues his attacks, especially at 33%.    
Below 33% health, Skorvald goes berserk and starts his *Solar Cyclone* attack. Practice the safe spots and keep the *Solar Blooms* away from the party, a
                <span class="text-ranger">Druid</span> is the perfect candidate for this job. After about 30 seconds, Skorvald starts a huge laser beam attack (*Beaming Smile*)
                and regains his defiance bar, if he is not dead yet break the bar and finish him.

            ## Intermediate part

            After Skorvald is dead, take the portal to the East and take the left portal in the control center area. You can activate a <Item id="78786"/> to walk during the cutscene and save some time.

            <p>You gain a new special action key:
                <kbd>Nova Launch</kbd>. For the moment, it is a 2100-range teleport with stunbreak that blocks the next attack (1.75s <Boon name="aegis"/>). Its cooldown refreshes after you bounce a *Globolla Marble*.
            </p>

            <p>You will encounter several glass mobs on the way to the second boss, there are no differences to the regular Shattered Observatory. After the first group of mobs,
                you will have to bounce a white *Globolla Marble* nine times with your head to progress. If you have a spare <Item id="78978"/> or <Item id="44642"/>, you can skip directly to Artsarriv using
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBvKQu9EqEc" rel="external">this cut</a>, otherwise use your
                <kbd>Nova Launch</kbd> to jump to
                <a href="/_/img/fractals/so-shortcut.jpg">this platform</a> and kill the elite mob there to proceed to Artsariiv.

            <p>The second boss of the fractal is Artsariiv. The encounter gets activated by bouncing a *Globolla Marble* into her, be sure to prepare <Boon name="might"/> and skills in the northwest beforehand.    
Artsariiv summons copies which split into smaller clones upon death, they use martial art skills,
                <Control name="knockdown"/>, shoot shocking projectiles and apply a lot of damaging conditions. Discuss whether you kill all adds (safe tactic) or not.    
Assign a player for the *Globolla Marble* bouncing and a backup in case the main bouncer gets *Corporal Reassignment*.</p>

            <p>You will need a lot of crowd control skills, consumables like <Item id="8759"/> and <Item id="8678"/> are very strong here.

            <h4>Tactic</h4>

            <p>Immediately after the fight starts, Artsariiv channels her huge triple-laser attack *Beaming Smile* (similar to Skorvald at low health). Do not get caught within those lasers or you die and turn away from her to prevent <Condition name="blind"/> and <Condition name="fear"/>.    
Kill the first *Temporal Anomaly* to spawn a containment for *Corporal Reassignment* and cleave the first set of clones. When you feel safe enough, move northwest to Artsariiv, break her defiance bar and bring her down to 66% health.
            </p>

            <p>At 66% and 33% health, Artsariiv splits up into five and nine clones respectively. Those clones can't be damaged and only despawn when their defiance bar is broken.
                All party members get resurrected afterwards, so don't waste time on dead players.    
The central clone has the highest priority as it shoots additional damaging orbs. Also pay attention to the single *Globolla Marble* during the CC phase, if it isn't bounced it deals medium damage to the party.
            </p>

            After the CC phases are over, Artsariiv reappears in the middle of the platform and conjures an *Obliterate* attack and multiple orange void zones which need to be dodged. She also does her *Beaming Smile* attack similar to the start of the fight. Kill the respawned *Temporal Anomaly* and clones (optional) before switching to her again.

            Below 66% health, Artsariiv throws a large *Globolla Marble* from time to time which needs to be bounced back to her over nine locations. Failing to bounce usually results in a party wipe, choose a reliable player beforehand to solo this.

            After the fight is over, take the portal in the North and move forward to get to Arkk.

            <p>Arkk is the third and final boss of the fractal. An attentive player may have noticed the
                <kbd>Nova Launch</kbd> special action key became even stronger now, doing medium damage, a 200 <Control name="launch"/> and executing a Blast finisher. Thanks to this, other crowd control skills are negligible for this fight.    
In contrast to the other enemies in the fractal, Arkk belongs to Scarlet's army and <Item id="50082"/> works against him.    
Arkk himself has no melee attacks, but a lot of abilities which can make the fight rather chaotic for inexperienced groups. However, all damage can be avoided and therefore a healer is not mandatory. More party DPS means less boss mechanics.    
Stack <Boon name="might"/> (you can use <kbd>Nova Launch</kbd>) and renew your *Mistlock Singularity* before activating the orb to teleport to Arkk.</p>

        <div class="col-12 col-lg-8">
            <h4>Tactic</h4>

            <p>Immediately when the fight starts, turn away as Arkk uses his *Blinding Radiance* ability. Always prioritize the respawning *Temporal Anomalies*, you only have a short time window to kill them before the player designated for *Corporal Reassignment* explodes.    
A lot of the mechanics can occur at the same time, practice to avoid every single one.    
Before triggering the Solar Bloom phases, you might want to wait for another Temporal Anomaly/Corporal Reassignment combination to prevent chaos during the intermediate phase.
            </p>

            <h5>Solar Blooms <span class="text-muted font-italic">80%, 50%, 30%</span></h5>
            <p>When Arkk reaches 80% health, he gains <Effect name="invulnerability"/> and players have to kite four *Solar Blooms* into the pillars in the corners to destroy them.    
A common strategy is to assign four players to the spawning locations in the North, East, South and West, as the Solar Blooms fixate on the closest player a few seconds after their spawn. Players take aggro of their designated Solar Bloom and kite them clockwise to the next pillar on the right. You can also use direct damage skills to push back the Blooms.    
The fifth, remaining player should be a DPS ready to take out a possibly spawning *Temporal Anomaly* during the phase. This player must also be ready to join the player with the green circle.    
After every Solar Bloom phase, Arkk's defiance bar has to be broken immediately or he kills all players. Use your
                <kbd>Nova Launch</kbd> ability for an additional <Control name="launch"/> if you are short on crowd control skills.</p>

            <h5>Elite Bosses <span class="text-muted font-italic">70%, 40%</span></h5>
            <p>At 70% and 40% of Arkk's health, the party gets teleported to another dimension where you have to fight the *Elite Archdiviner* from the Cliffside fractal and the *Elite Brazen Gladiator* from the Chaos fractal respectively.    
Both bosses behave similar to their real version and are surrounded by four mobs (Cultists/Golems). Try to kill the adds before finishing the boss as they follow you back to Arkk. Remember the party-wide <Control name="daze"/> if the third auto-attack of the Gladiator hits someone.</p>

            <h5>Final phase <span class="text-muted font-italic">&lt;40%</span></h5>
            <p>Below 40% health, random platforms start disappearing temporarily. Due to this mechanic, space is very limited and resurrecting a downed player is nearly impossible.
                Sometimes *Temporal Anomalies* spawn on vanished platforms which makes the fight even more challenging.    
The most important thing is to keep calm. Remember that every single ability can be avoided, reflect and jump over the *Solar Fury* orbs, jump or dodge through the *Starburst Cascade* and *Solar Stomp *attacks, turn away from the *Blinding Radiance* and move accordingly to the *Horizon Strike* pattern. If you dont have any dodges left, use your
                <kbd>Nova Launch</kbd> skill to counter mechanics. Keep a cool head and finish the fight!</p>
