## Assault Knights <Item id="50082" disableText/><Label>426,071 HP</Label>

Stack <Boon name="might"/> before jumping down. Kill the three _Assault Knights_ (Red, Blue and Green), each of them has the same set of abilities: a PBAoE <Control name="knockdown"/> and an AoE <Control name="pull"/> which covers the entire room except the knight's position, both can be dodged.

Break their defiance bars, kill them to awaken MAMA and use `/gg` to reset your cooldowns.

| Encounter duration | 53s |
| Sigils | <Item name="impact"/> <Item name="Force"/> |

| CC-bar MAMA | 1800 |
| CC-bar adds | 800 |

Stack <Boon name="might"/>, <Boon name="Quickness"/> and <Boon name="Alacrity"/> before jumping down. In organized teams use a <Item name="watchworkportaldevice"/> to teleport from the mistlcok to siax.

The duration of the encounter heavily relies on how quickly your party can break the defiance bars throughout the fight, in addition to the amount of damage your party can generate in each phase. This is an average clear time and can be reached by organized teams as well as pick up groups. The class outlines below will be suitable for faster and slower kills as well.

MAMA will arise, after being invulnerable for a few seconds its first attack will be a _spinning <Control name="knockback"/>_. This one should be interrupted by CCing the boss fast enough. The consecutive spin attacks should be taken care of by the <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> as long as there is not to much AoE, that potentially removes <Boon name="Aegis"/> is around. This spin attack always hits on the _second_ spin animation.

Apart from that, turn away from your party members shortly before the _Vomit Toxin_ hits (orange cone), otherwise you will 'infect' party members in front of you with it.

Every 25%, MAMA gets <Effect name="invulnerability"/> and an _Assault Knight_ (similar to the knights before) will spawn. Quickly break their defiance bar and burst them down as MAMA will continue it's attacks.

When MAMA reaches 33%, it conjures a large _Nightmare Miasma_ field around it which deals enormous damage. It will also become mobile, start jumping to players, offloading shockwaves which <Control name="knockdown"/> and attacking with <Control name="stun"/> cones. It is especially important to immediately kill the last _Assault Knight_ at 25% health.

Fast crowd control and animation knowledge are the keys to this fight.

**Suggested Boon Duration** `50%`   

Maintaining <Boon name="Alacrity"/> in this encounter does not requier higher boon duration due to the length of the fight. However, should your party drop <Boon name="Alacrity"/> you will have to adjust your boon duration to accomodate your team.  Low boon duration will have a significant impact on your personal damage output. 

---

**Precast**  
* Cast <Skill name="Ordersfromabove"/> for <Boon name="Alacrity"/> and <Skill name="Renewingwave"/> to blast, take the mistlock and repeat. The two casts of <Skill name="Ordersfromabove"/> overlaps and grants twice the duration of <Boon name="Alacrity"/>. You can use <Skill name="DroptheHammer"/> for an additional blast if needed.

**100 - 75%**  

* Cast <Skill name="DarkrazorsDaring"/> on MAMA as soon as the red cirlce appear. 
* Cast <Skill name="IcerazorsIre"/> right before MAMA becomes vulnerable.
* Use <Skill name="Surgeofthemists"/> to break the defiance bar. Be aware of your positioning to gain an additional hit. 
* Weapon swap and change to <Skill name="LegendaryAssassinstance"/> to gain the extra energy from the trait <Trait name="ChargedMists"/>. 
* Activate <Skill name="Impossibleodds"/>, use <Skill name="citadel bombardment"/> and <Skill name="PrecisionStrike"/> before sharing <Boon name="Alacrity"/> with <Skill name="OrdersfromAbove"/>.

**1st Add**   
* Use <Skill name="Shackling Wave"/>. 
* Change to <Skill name="Legendary Renegade stance"/> to use <Skill name="Heroic Command"/> to share <Boon name="might"/>.

**75-50%** 
* Cast <Skill name="SoulcleavesSummit"/>  and <Skill name="Icerazorâ€™s Ire"/> on MAMA.
* Share <Boon name="Alacrity"/> with <Skill name="Orders from Above"/> when off cooldown. 
* Weapon swap to staff near the end of the phase.

**2nd Add**  
* Precast <Skill name="Darkrazorâ€™s Daring"/> where the add will spawn.
* Change to <Skill name="Legendary Assassin stance"/>. 
* Share <Boon name="might"/> with <Skill name="Heroic Command"/>.


**50-25%**

* Weapon swap and change to <Skill name="Legendary Assassin Stance"/>. 
* Activate <Skill name="Impossible Odds"/>, cast <Skill name="Citadel Bombardment"/> and <Skill name="Precision Strike"/>.

**Annotation**
* If your second phase is fast you might want to deactivate <Skill name="Soulcleaves Summit"/> to have enough energy to share <Boon name="Alacrity"/> with <Skill name="Orders from Above"/> and precast <Skill name="Darkrazors Daring"/> on the second add.
* If your second phase is slow you can let <Skill name="Soulcleaves Summit"/> deplete your energy, before replenishing enough energy to share <Boon name="Alacrity"/> and precast <Skill name="Darkrazors Daring"/> on the second add.
* Adjust your weapon swap to staff in the second phase to accomodate the weapon swap back to swords for the burst in phase three.

## First set of altars <Item id="50082" disableText/><Item id="24658" disableText/>
Swap your weopen set to <Item name="Impact"/> and <Item name="Serpentslaying"/>. You need to cap two altars to continue. Pull the two groups of Krait back to the passage and kill all enemies there. Start capping the altars as soon as possible, but keep in mind that standing inside puts <Effect name="agony"/> on yourself. Only enemy Krait counteract the capping here, you can ignore the Hallucinations.    
Learn the *Red Orb* patterns as they can quickly kill you, *Blue Orbs* will heal you for a large amount of health (even with Agony).    
On a side note, more players do not cap an altar faster. More than one person standing inside is redundant.

## Second set of altars <Item id="50082" disableText/><Item id="24658" disableText/>

Again, pull all enemies to the center (wait for the <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> to cast <Skill id="9147"/>) and kill them there. The mobs at the left altar (West) can be aggroed with a simple projectile, the mobs on the right side (East) need to be pulled with <Skill id="14381"/> (Longbow), <Skill id="14575"/>, <Skill id="5491"/> (Staff) or by teleporting up and jumping down.

Both side altars can easily be capped by a single person after another player has pulled down the mobs. Please note that you have to wait until the mobs are down before teleporting elsewhere to prevent them from running back.

Contrary to the first set of altars, respawning _Veteran Hallucinations_ counteract capping here. Use <Control name="pull"/> to grab them out of the central altar and always have a positive amount of players inside.

After you capped all three altars, use `/gg` immediately if someone in the party needs it, then you can continue up to the 2nd boss. Before the ramp up, a group of Krait will attack you - simply keep walking to skip them. Use dodges, evades or invulnerables to get through the cascading orbs and disable them by walking through the orb at the top of the ramp.

Usually a single person with high mobility (<Specialization name="Warrior"/>, <Specialization name="Dragonhunter"/>, <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/>, <Specialization name="Weaver"/>) and <Item name="endlesschoyapinatatonic"/> or <Item id="49940"/> skips to Siax while the rest of the party stays dead. Trigger Siax and wait for Siax to appear, then `/gg` aswell.

<Tabs>
<Tab specialization="weaver">
<Skill id="5738"/> is very strong against the groups of Krait.

Use <Skill id="5536"/> to teleport up to the altars.

You can pull both sides with <Skill id="5491"/> (for the right side, jump at the end of your [cast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNZEM9StauU)).

If the person who pulled your side ported up the other side to fast and the mobs come back use <Skill id="5683"/> and <Skill id="5686"/> to prevent them from reachin the circle before it is tabbed. Make sure you are attuned correctly for this in time.

<Tab specialization="warrior">
Exchange <Skill id="14502"/> for <Skill name="on my mark" profession="Warrior"/> and already swap to your weapon sets with Superior Sigil of Serpent Slaying.

At the first set of altars draw the Elite Nightmare Hypnoss with <Skill name="on my mark" profession="Warrior"/> to the narrow corridor so that the <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> can pull them together with <Skill name="Binding Blade"/> and disable them with <Skill name="Tremor" profession="Warrior"/>. Assist in killing the Elite Nightmare Hypnoss and capturing one of the two altars. 

At the second set of altars, wait for your <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> to pull them together with <Skill name="Binding Blade"/> and disable the Elite Nightmare Hypnoss with <Skill name="Tremor" profession="Warrior"/>. Immediately move close to the altar on the right side and pull the Elite Nightmare Hypnoss occupying the altar to the mid by using <Skill name="on my mark" profession="Warrior"/>. Assist in killing the remaining Elite Nightmare Hypnoss and capture the mid altar respectively.
</Tab>
<Tab specialization="dragonhunter">
Use <Skill name="Binding Blade"/> and <Skill name="Dragonsmaw"/> excessively to pull as many mobs as possible.

Stack <Boon name="might"/>, <Boon name="Quickness"/> and <Boon name="Alacrity"/> before approaching the red orb and starting the fight. In organized teams use a <Item name="watchworkportaldevice"/> to teleport from the mistlcok to siax.

The duration of the encounter heavily relies on how much damage your group can generate in each phase and how quickly you can finish the adds. This is a rather fast clear time and can be reached by organized teams. Pick up groups might have a hard time reaching this duration, however the class-outlines below are still suitable for slower kills.

During the fight, break his defiance bar (2000 CC damage) as fast as possible to interrupt his _Caustic Explosion_ skill. Siax will wipe your party if you fail to interrupt it with enough crowd control. Pay attention to his bouncing orb barrages, the _Vomit Toxin_ and the exploding _Volatile Hallucinations_ (below 75% health). Do not stand in the red PBAoE when the inner circle reaches the outer to avoid spawning a _Nightmare Hallucination_. Watch your buffs: the <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> should give you <Boon name="Aegis"/>, which blocks this attack and requires no further action from your side.

When Siax reaches 66% health, he gains <Effect name="invulnerability"/> and four _Echoes of the Unclean_ will spawn in the North, East, South and West which need to be killed quickly to interrupt his _Caustic Explosions_. The same occurs at 33%, though the adds will have their spawning positions shifted clockwise.

Assign players to each add before the fight starts by setting waypoints. In PuGs the <Specialization name="firebrand"/> and <Specialization name="renegade"/> will usually focus on one mob together due to their lower DPS.

* Immediately use <Skill name="Surgeofthemists"/> to finish of the defiance bar.
* When you are through the hitbox weapon swap and use <Skill name="Precision Strike"/>.
* Share <Boon name="Alacrity"/> with <Skill name="Orders from Above"/>. 
* Share <Boon name="might"/> at the end of the phase with <Skill name="Heroic Command"/>.

**1st Add**

    * Activate <Skill name="Impossible Odds"/>, cast <Skill name="Citadel Bombardment"/> and spend time autoattacking. 
    * Change to <Skill name=" Legendary Renegade Stance"/> and use <Skill name="Surge of the mists"/> before continuing with the steps listed above.
* In faster kills it might not be worth sharing <Boon name="Alacrity"/> in the first phase, rather wait until the beginnning of the second phase.
* In slower kills you will have to swap to staff after the second add and use <Skill name="Surge of the mists"/> to break the defiance bar. Casting <Skill name="Darkrazors Daring"/> will also be beneficial in this circumstance.
* If you are running higher boon duration you will have to use <Skill name="Precision Strike"/> and <Skill name="Shackling Wave"/> on your add to kill it quick enough in both phases.

It feels really bad to reach the boss with your add surviving with less than 1% life).

Continue with <Skill id="5531"/> on Siax and restart in <Skill id="5492"/>.

If your group damage is too low to pick up your second <Skill id="5516"/> for the second add, place a <Skill id="5548"/> on it, attune to <Skill id="5494" disableText/>/<Skill id="5492" disableText/> and use <Skill id="41125"/> to kill it quickly.

Continue with <Skill id="5494" disableText/>/<Skill id="5492" disableText/> and <Skill id="5737"/> on Siax.

If you play with three weavers split your <Skill id="5737"/> so you have one each phase.

If you want to try hard play air instead of arcane, use <Skill id="21656" /> and pre cast <Skill id="5501"/> before the fight to have it ready fast enough in phase 2 and 3.

<Tab specialization="Dragonhunter">
**tl;dr**
- Use your <Skill name="Binding Blade"/> inside Siax' hitbox to get 5 additional hits. This is the reson why dragonhunter is very strong at this boss. Do not miss this.
- Save some <Skill id="9168"/> for a quicker add kill. 
- It is benefical to take a sword here to quickly blink to the add.
- Use <Skill name="Wings of resolve"/> to navigate around and keep your HP up.
- Use <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> to help with CC and buff your party.
- Use <Skill name="shieldofwrath"/> and <Skill name="Shieldofcourage"/> to block the expanding AoEs.

---

**Precast**
- Precast all Traps (<Skill id="30025"/>, <Skill id="30364"/>, <Skill id="29786"/>, <Skill id="30553"/> and <Skill id="30273"/>) on the boss and force your team to `/gg`. 
- Use <Skill name="Empower"/> to help with might. Blast the fire field with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> and <Skill name="Mighty blow"/>.
- Use <Skill name="Feelmywrath"/>.
- Take the mistlock.

**100%-66%**

Your gameplay is heavily influenced by the dps your team can pull. If your team has very high dps (phases Siax in >5s) you wanna precast <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> and fire everything you have as soon as you are getting in combat.  
No matter what group you are running with, start on scepter/sword! If you are running in a PuG or just clear it daily, it is benefical to delay your traps slightly, to fit more of the hits into the cc bar. In a fast team save <Skill name="bindingblade"/> for the 2nd phase when the adds spawn, if not use it. Just make sure to press it when the adds are in range for big dps.

**1st Add**

- Use <Skill name="spearofjustice"/> on your add for the modifier from <Trait name="biggamehunter"/>. 
- <Skill name="Whirling wrath"/> and a couple AA to kill it.
- Use <Skill name="wingsofresolve"/>, <Skill name="Symbol of blades"/> and <Skill name="Leapoffaith"/> for movement.

**66%-33%**

Nothing extraordinary, all information from 100-66 and tl;dr are still valid. Try to end on scepter/sword.

**2nd Add**

- Use <Skill name="spearofjustice"/> on your add for the modifier from <Trait name="biggamehunter"/>. 
- Kill it with a symbol and AAs.
- In fast times you might wanna save a <Skill name="Swordofjustice"/>.

**33%-0%**

Nothing extraordinary, all information from 100-66 and tl;dr are still valid. Try to end on scepter/sword.

## Ensolyss of the Endless Torment <Label>14,059,890 HP</Label>
|  |  |
| -- | -- |
| Encounter duration | 1:55min |
| Sigils | <Item name="impact"/> <Item name="serpentslaying"/> |
| Food | <Item id="41569"/> <Item name="powerfulpotionofslayingscarletsarmies"/>|
| CC | 2000 |

<Grid>
<GridItem>
Walk through the teleporter and trigger Ensolyss once after defeating Siax to gain the new checkpoint and use `/gg` to reset all cooldowns. Stack <Boon name="might"/>, <Boon name="Quickness"/> and <Boon name="Alacrity"/> before starting the fight. Good teams will use a <Item id="78978"/> to teleport to the boss. When you start the fight don't stand in the center area of the platform or you will receive a <Control name="knockback"/>. Right after he looses his <Effect name="invulnerability"/> there is a CC bar. This bar is only breakable for approximately one second. Time your CC wise. 

Nearly all of Ensolyss' attacks do a <Control name="knockback"/> or <Control name="pull"/>, learn to dodge or walk out of every attack. The most dangerous one is his shockwave-shatter combo, he smashes down a stunning yellow shockwave (like MAMA below 33% health), spawns hallucinations on each players position and shatters them after two seconds.

Again, the key to this fight is fast crowd control. Break his defiance bar quickly to interrupt his high damage attacks. Always stack around the center area and do not try to follow him to the edge as he will simply teleport back most of the time.

### Orb phases <Label>66%, 33%</Label>

At 66% and 33%, Ensolyss will teleport to the middle and gain <Effect name="invulnerability"/>. Your party will need to split up and cap five altars, similar to the ones before.  
_Red Orbs_ and stunning shockwaves emerge from the middle, learn the patterns to avoid any damage. Try to catch the _Blue Orbs_ as they heal you for a significant amount. Note that _Blue Orbs_ only spawn at 66% if all altars are capped as fast as possible.

After the orb phases, the defiance bar needs to be broken immediately to prevent Ensolyss from knocking everyone off the platform. His defiance bar will recover shortly after being broken for the first time, break it a second time (especially at 33% health) to further prevent his attacks and deal more damage thanks to <Item id="24868"/> and <Trait id="1502"/>.

Below 66%, Ensolyss gains a new ability where he smashes two quarters of the platform subsequently and knocks everyone inside the **orange** areas off the platform, similar to the skill immediately after the orb phases. It it safe to stand inside the **purple** areas.

Below 33%, he may summon a special shockwave which travels inwards to him (contrary to the ones before) and deal enormous damage to everyone near him. With enough crowd control and DPS this should never occur.

### Final phase <Label><15%</Label>

When Ensolyss reaches 15% health, he will stop using his usual attacks, but only a small bubble in the middle will protect you from his deathly rain. Krait will charge through the middle (indicated by large arrows on the ground) and make positioning harder, kill Ensolyss quickly to finish the fractal.

<Tab specialization="Soulbeast">
In no <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> comp you wanna play <Skill name="Moastance"/> over <Skill name="Signet of the wild"/>. Use <Skill name="Moastance"/> at the beginning of each phase. Regardless what group you are playing with, you should be playing <Trait name="Leaderofthepack"/>. Longbow is superior to greatsword.

**Opening**  
- Right after Ensolyss spawns: <Skill id="5531"/> and <Skill name="Barrage"/>
- <Skill id="45743"/>, <Skill name="Pointblankshot"/> for insta CC
- <Skill name="onewolfpack"/>, <Skill name="sicem"/>

<Tab specialization="warrior">
This is one of the fights, where berserker shines bright. As soon as you do not instabreak CC it makes sense to play <Specialization name="Warrior"/>. 

### **<Specialization name="Berserker"/>** (Standard Axe/Axe Mace/Mace)
Berserker is really strong on this encounter, because your <Skill name="Berserk"/> perfectly aligns with phase durations. There are some interesting weopen choices: if your team manages CC you can take an offhand torch for more dps. Remember to swap back to <Trait id="1977"/>. 

**Opening:**
- <Skill name="Mending"/> when he appears
- <Skill name="Tremor"/> start to cast a few milliseconds before he looses <Effect name="invulnerability"/>
- <Skill name="Headbutt"/>
- <Skill name="Berserk"/>

**66% and 33%**

Pick up your banners and swap to your off set (mace/torch). After everyone capped their circle, try to blast a fire field with your banners. Then go on:
- <Skill name="crushingblow"/>
- <Skill name="Mending"/>
- <Skill name="Tremor"/> 
- <Skill name="Headbutt"/>
- <Skill name="Berserk"/>

### **<Specialization name="Warrior"/>** (Standard Axe/Axe Mace/Mace)

Begin the encounter on Axe/Axe with <Skill id="14402"/>, <Skill id="14502"/>, <Skill name="Eviscerate" profession="Warrior"/>, <Skill name="Whirling Axe" profession="Warrior"/>, <Skill name="Dual Strike" profession="Warrior"/>, <Skill name="Throw Axe" profession="Warrior"/>, <Skill name="Cyclone Axe" profession="Warrior"/> and immediately swap to Mace/Mace to break Ensolyss's Defiance bar with <Skill name="Tremor" profession="Warrior"/>, <Skill name="Pommel Bash" profession="Warrior"/> and <Skill name="Skull Crack" profession="Warrior"/>.

Once Ensolyss's
Defiance bar is broken continue with standard rotation on Axe/Axe. At 66% and 33% swap to Mace/Mace and capture one of the five altars.

As soon as Ensolyss returns attack with <Skill name="Mace Smash" profession="Warrior"/>, <Skill name="Mace Bash" profession="Warrior"/> and <Skill name="Pulverize" profession="Warrior"/> until the Defiance bar appears.

Immediately use <Skill name="Tremor" profession="Warrior"/>, <Skill name="Skull Crack" profession="Warrior"/> (if <Skill id="14502"/> won't break Ensolyss's Defiance bar use <Item id="8664"/>, <Item id="8677"/> and <Item id="8749"/>), <Skill id="14502"/> and continue standard rotation until the second Defiance bar appears. Break it with <Skill name="Pommel Bash"/>, <Skill name="Skull Crack" profession="Warrior"/> and <Item id="8664"/>, <Item id="8677"/>, <Item id="8749"/>, <Skill id="14502"/> and resume standard rotation.

Keep an eye on <Condition name="vulnerability"/> stacks and use <Skill name="crushing blow" profession="Warrior"/> if it runs low.
</Tab>

<Tab specialization="weaver">
Start the fight in <Skill id="5495" disableText/>/<Skill id="5492" disableText/> with <Skill id="5531"/> followed <Skill id="5528"/> while Ensolyss spawns, continue with <Skill id="5548"/> and <Skill id="5491"/> until <Skill id="5548"/> is ready again. Know cast your situational opener to hit as much damage as possible in the breakbar.

If your damage is low and he charges cast your second <Skill id="5501"/> in the middle of the platform after dodging his first charge. If all five players stand there he will teleport back into it.

If you have two or more weavers one should take <Skill id="5567"/> and switch weapons with the other weavers.

If you summond you <Skill id="5516"/> in phase one pick it up before the orbs spawn and keep it the whole orb phase.

Start the fight at 66% with the <Skill id="5495" disableText/>/<Skill id="5492" disableText/> opener. Use <Skill id="5531"/> if you have a <Skill id="5516"/> in hand.

Hit the second breakbar with either <Skill id="5733"/> or <Skill id="5721"/>.

After the orb phases, reopen in <Skill id="5495" disableText/>/<Skill id="5492" disableText/> and cast <Skill id="5528"/> about a second before the orb phase ends. Make sure to have your <Skill id="5501"/> either finished before the first <Control name="knockback"/> zone goes off or start it after making sure you won't get hit.

If you are close to either 66% or 33% and have your <Skill id="5516"/> in hand, you can use <Skill id="5697"/> through his hitbox to get as many hits as possible.

You can double attune <Skill id="5495" disableText/>/<Skill id="5495" disableText/> 2-3 second before the orb phase ends to restart the fight with <Trait id="2131"/> up.

Keep in mind that in the long break phases especially with double cc <Skill id="40183"/> is pretty strong.

**Record**  
The only difference to the normal run is that you want your dps to be good enough to prevent the charge in p1. Preventing the first bubble in p2 and preventing the port in p3. But with the last weaver nerfs all those marks are now very hard to hit.
