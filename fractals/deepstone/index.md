## Start: Picking a path, the Brood Queen (Spider)

Commonly the Brood Queen is picked first. On your way to the _Brood Queen_ you will see spider nests, destroy them. You have to stand on two cyan glowing runes in the middle of the bridge to unblock the path to the _Brood Queen_. There are telegraphed windblows that are unblockable, if you happen to get hit by one it puts you back at the start of the bridge. Kill the two elite _Broodmother Spider_ to spawn the _Brood Queen_. This boss does not hit hard and most attack are telegraphed. After killing her the crystal energy ball comes down. Take it and you get spawned back in the middle. Take the ball to the Vibrant crystal in the end of the hall and move on to the left side of the dungeon.

## The Deepstone Sentinel (Air Elemental)

Before the _Deepstone Sentinel_, there is a tetris-like obstacle you have to pass. You have to avoid the green tiles because it damages you. You can dodge the gaps between the safe tiles and proceed to the end. After two players passed, they stand on the cyan glowing runes to stop the tetris trap so others can pass. After prestacking <Boon name="might"/> at the Mistlock Singularity move in and the _Deepstone Sentinel_ spawns. The only dangerous attack it has is an AoE tornado (called Wind Sprites) that you have to dodge at every 20%. It is a well telegraphed attack so you only have to make sure you are not standing in it 1 second later. If it manages to catch you, others have to use CC to break you out of it before it floats you to the depths and kill you. There is a possiblity you get caught even if you not standing in it, use Skill 1 to break out of it. The other three attacks are a mini tornado that applies <Condition name="chill"/> and the AoEs that <Control name="daze"/>, the third attack is a projectile it shoots inbetween which can be reflected. After killing the _Deepstone Sentinel_ the crystal energy orb spawns, take it and intract with the Vibrant Crystal in the middle.

## The Shadow Minotaur

After merging the second orb with the Vibrant Crystal, you get a Special Action Key skill called Light of Deldrimor. This skill is used to reveal hidden chest in the dungeon as well as making the mobs 10% more vulnerable and it also serves as revealing the Shadow Minotaur in the central chamber. After killing the Shadow Minotaur and the Imps the door in the middle chamber opens. Go in and move on to the next obstacle, the Maze.

## Maze

Here you have to use the Light of Deldrimor to reveal the hidden tiles of the maze. Move to the right as the first orb of light is revealed for you. From there you proceed on to the next orb of light to your left or the bottom left on the minimap. After revealing all four the maze's tiles reveal themselves and you can move on to the "elevator".

## Elevator (Sinking platform)

After standing on the rune in the middle of the platform it proceeds to go downward. It stops in the middle and mobs spawn. Use the Light of Deldrimor to make them more vulnerable and after killing them the platform moves downward again.

## The Voice

Prestack <Boon name="might"/> and proceed to the boss. The boss has several mechanics. The first you will notice is he is teleporting to a random location of the arena at every 10%. The tiles of the arena can be revealed with the Light of Deldrimor skill. Spam this skill all the time and you won't have a problem with disappearing tiles. At 80% and then 40% _The Voice_ teleports away and gains a breakbar while casting beam on you that makes the tiles disappear under you. If you do not manage to break the breakbar fast enough he gains a barrier you have to remove. At 60% and 20% _The Voice_ teleports to the middle, becoming invulnerable and you have to keep away _Spectral Flames_ from him. _Spectral Flames_ make the tiles disappear under them. Use Light of Deldrimor skill to make them invulnerable to _Spectral Flames_. If a _Spectral Flame_ manages to reach _The Voice_, he casts a huge AoE that damages you. After the 20% invulnerability he doesn't teleport away and you can nuke him. After defeating _The Voice_ the fractal is finished.
