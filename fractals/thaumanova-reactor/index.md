## Start
<Grid>
<Column>
Activate the *Detonator* and wait for the Mesmer to open a portal (in this case, stack <Boon name="might"/>) or walk up to the *Elite Flame Legion Fire Shaman*. Kill him and split up to disable the four colliders.

## Turret room (South)
This should be done by two support classes (usually the Warrior and the Druid). Learn the timing of the turret shots and jump or dodge over them. You can also take a *Safety Shield* from the beginning and use it to block shots for a short duration.    
One person activates the console to the left (1) to grant the other person short access to the console at the right (2).    
Activating (2) enables short access to the two final consoles at (3). You can bypass the <Condition name="immobile"/> from triggering them by standing exactly in the middle and pressing both at the same time.

## Researcher Dormitories (East)
<Grid>
<Column>
**Both DPS** should do this area immediately after the Elite Flame Legion Fire Shaman. Remember to destroy the Unstable Portals as well. Finishing this event in time will grant you a damage boost for the end boss.
</Column>

<Column>
<Tips>
    <Tip specialization="tempest">Stack <Boon name="might"/> before the door opens. Be sure to place your <Skill id="29719"/> between two gates to hit both.</Tip>
</Tips>
</Column>

## Superheated Room (West)
This is usually solo'ed by the Mesmer using <Skill id="29578"/>, <Skill id="29830"/>, <Skill id="10200"/>, dodge jumps and heals from <Skill id="10213"/> and <Trait id="740"/> but other classes can do it as well.

## Ooze Room (Subject 6 - Northwest)
<Grid>
<Column>
Gather at Subject 6 after finishing the other three colliders. During the fight, small and large (75%/50/25%) Oozes will spawn and move to him slowly, restoring his health when they reach him. Subject 6 also has a *Shield Form*, hitting him then will give him stacks of *Overload*. Reaching 20 stacks results in a party wipe. There are two main tactics for killing it:

**Option 1 (easy):** Everyone goes AFK until Subject 6 blocks for the first time. After the blocking is over, nuke him without killing any Oozes.    
Requires high damage and depends on RNG as the blocking occurs at random times.

**Option 2 (coordinated):** The team nukes from the beginning ignoring the Oozes, but refrains from using crowd control effects and breaking his defiance bar. If Subject 6 starts blocking, immediately break the defiance bar using unblockable CC skills to bypass the Overload mechanic.
</Column>

<Column>
<Tips>
    <Tip specialization="warrior">Equip <Skill id="14404"/> to make your CC skills unblockable.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="thief">Share <Skill id="13132"/> with 5 allies to deal 750 unblockable defiance bar damage.</Tip>

## Thaumanova Anomaly
<Grid>
<Column>
After all four colliders are disabled, use `/gg` to reset any cooldowns and resurrect directly at the Thaumanova Anomaly console. Activate it to teleport up and stack <Boon name="might"/>.    
During the fight, try to stack as much as possible on a single platform and alternate the special *Hex Shield* skill between players for her *Gaze* attack (the beam dissolving the platforms) and the *Cosmic Instability* debuff (occuring at 50%). The *Flux Bomb* debuff will also cause nearby platforms to disappear.
</Column>

<Column>
<Tips>
    <Tip specialization="chronomancer">You can freely cast *Hex Shield* during <Skill id="29830"/> for an additional safe spot.</Tip>
