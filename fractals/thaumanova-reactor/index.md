<Column>
Activate the *Detonator* and wait for the <Specialization name="mesmer"/> to open a portal (in this case, stack <Boon name="might"/> in the vestibule) or walk up to the *Elite Flame Legion Fire Shaman*. Kill him, `/gg` to reset your cooldowns and split up to disable the four colliders.

## Turret room <Label>South</Label>
This should be done by two support classes (usually the <Specialization name="warrior"/> and the <Specialization name="druid"/>). Learn the timing of the turret shots and jump or dodge over them. You can also take a *Safety Shield* from the beginning and use it to block shots for a short duration.

One person activates the console to the left <Label circular>1</Label> to grant the other person short access to the console at the right <Label circular>2</Label>.

Activating <Label circular>2</Label> enables short access to the two final consoles at <Label circular>3</Label>. You can bypass the <Condition name="immobile"/> from triggering them by standing exactly in the middle and pressing both buttons at the same time.

## Researcher Dormitories <Label>East</Label>

<Column>
**Both DPS** should do this area immediately after the Elite Flame Legion Fire Shaman. Remember to destroy the Unstable Portals as well. Finishing this event in time will grant you a 10% damage boost for the endboss.

## Superheated Room <Label>West</Label>
This is usually solo'ed by the <Specialization name="mesmer"/> using <Skill id="29578"/>, <Skill id="29830"/>, <Skill id="10200"/>, dodge jumps and heals from <Skill id="10213"/> and <Trait id="740"/> but other classes can do it as well.

## <Boss/> Ooze Room: Subject 6 <Label>Northwest</Label>
<Grid>
<Column>
Gather at Subject 6 after finishing the other three colliders. During the fight, small and large (at 75%/50/25% health) Oozes will spawn and move toward it slowly, restoring its health when they reach it. Subject 6 also has a easily distinguishable *Shield Form*, hitting him then will give him stacks of *Overload*. Reaching 20 stacks results in a party wipe.

There are two main tactics for killing it:

**Option 1 (easy):** Everyone goes AFK until Subject 6 blocks for the first time. After the blocking is over, nuke him without killing any Oozes.    
Requires high damage and you may have to wait a while as the blocking occurs at random times.

**Option 2 (coordinated):** The team nukes from the beginning ignoring the Oozes, but refrains from using crowd control effects and breaking his defiance bar. If Subject 6 starts blocking, immediately break the defiance bar using **unblockable** CC skills to bypass the Overload mechanic.

<Column>
<Tips>
    <Tip specialization="warrior">Equip <Skill id="14404"/> to make your CC skills unblockable.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="thief">Share <Skill id="13132"/> with 5 allies to deal 750 unblockable defiance bar damage.</Tip>

## <Boss red/> Thaumanova Anomaly
<Grid>
<Column>
After all four colliders are disabled, use `/gg` to reset any cooldowns and resurrect directly at the Thaumanova Anomaly console. Activate it to teleport up and stack <Boon name="might"/>.    
During the fight, try to stack as much as possible on one or two adjacent platforms but don't die from <Instability name="Social Awkwardness"/> (present on both difficulties).

Alternate the special *Hex Shield* skill between players for her *Gaze* attack (the beam dissolving the platforms) and the *Cosmic Instability* debuff (occuring after 50% health). The *Flux Bomb* debuff will also cause nearby platforms to disappear.
