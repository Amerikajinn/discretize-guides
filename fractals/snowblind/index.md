## Ice Wall
<Grid>
<Column width="10">
Light up the *Bonfire* with your special action key skill. Kill the spawning *Icebrood Elementals* to prevent them from extinguishing it and throw *Firewood* into it to keep it burning. After around 75 seconds, the ice wall will melt.    
If you gain too many stacks of *Hypothermia* (one every 5 seconds), reset them at the bonfire.

## Elemental Source

<Grid>
<Column>
At the start of the fight, light up the five bonfires to remove the 10 stacks of *Rime Shield* from the boss. Each stack reduces its damage taken by 10%.    
Every 25%, the Elemental Source casts *Wind Gust* (icy projectiles) which makes the bonfires loose health. If a bonfire goes down, you will need to throw firewood into and light it up again.    
Simply do enough damage and utilize reflects before letting all bonfires expire.

## Forest

After the Elemental Source is destroyed, everyone except the fastest player can <Command name="gg"/> and wait for the next checkpoint at the cave to trigger. Mobility skills and <Item id="49940"/> are very good here.

## Shaman Lornarr Dragonseeker
<Grid>
<Column>
Stack <Boon name="might"/> before the final boss. He gains 3 stacks of *Rime Shield* reducing his incoming damage from the three respawning *Corrupted Ice Crystals*, destroy them before focusing the Shaman. At 75%, 50% and 25% you will need to kill a summoned *Icebrood Effigy*. Basically dodge every red circle during the fight and break the defiance bars immediately to prevent mechanics.
