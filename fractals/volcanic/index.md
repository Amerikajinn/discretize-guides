## Start
<Grid>
<Column>
Kill the respawning Grawls to fill the progress bar. Afterwards, use the Mesmer's portal or walk through the Boulders to the Grawl Shaman.
</Column>

<Column>
<Tips>
    <Tip specialization="mesmer">While the others kill the Grawls, open a <Skill id="10197"/> at <a href="/_/img/fractals/volcanic-1.jpg">this location</a> and walk to the next area. Wait for the others to finish (recognizable by the experience gain and the video sequence) and open the portal <a href="/_/img/fractals/volcanic-2.jpg">here</a>.</Tip>

## Grawl Shaman
Kill the spawning *Veteran Grawl Shamans* to prevent them from sacrificing the captives.    
You will need to throw eight *Infused Stones* at the bubble protecting the Grawl Shaman boss to break it. The stones spawn on rockfalls, wait until the falling animation finishes and dodge into it to collect it.    
After the bubble is broken, stand <a href="/_/img/fractals/volcanic-3.jpg">here</a> to LoS the boss. He will come down immediately. Throw another *Infused Stone* at him if his bubble reappears.

## Imbued Shaman
<Grid>
<Column>
Take <a href="/_/img/fractals/volcanic-4.jpg">this shortcut</a> to trigger the next checkpoint, then everyone uses <Command name="gg"/> to reset cooldowns. Walk until the end of the boardwalk, stack <Boon name="might"/> and jump down to the Imbued Shaman.

Every 25%, he gains a protective bubble and starts moving to a random villager. He will heal for about 20% health if he reaches his target, so break the bubble quickly by hitting him 40 times and try to keep him in the center as the villagers are located at the edge of the area.    
He will also spawn 10-30 *Lava Elementals* during this phase, kill them fast as they cast a lot of projectiles and inflict high <Condition name="burning"/> stacks on the team.    
Note that jumping prevents the application of <Condition name="burning"/> from the floor.    
Avoid the *Bash* and *Wing Buffer* attacks (they <Control name="knockback"/>) and utilize conditions clears & reflects to finish the fractal successfully.

<Column>
<Tips>
    <Tip specialization="mesmer">Use <Skill id="10302"/> against the Lava Elementals. A <Skill id="10186"/> traited with <Trait id="751"/> is also worth it, though you lose the personal condition cleanse from <Trait id="740"/>.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="elementalist">Take <Skill id="5507"/> for an additional condition cleanse.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="guardian">Take <Skill id="9251"/> for reflection and <Skill id="31159"/> against the <Condition name="burning"/>.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="ranger">Trait <Trait id="1075"/> and use <Skill id="12489"/> for additional condition clears.</Tip>
