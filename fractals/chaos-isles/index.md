## Start
Kill the four *Veteran Chanters* at the beginning to open the gate. The fastest person can rush ahead and move to the next checkpoint at the *Chaos Anomaly*, everyone else can `/gg` and resurrect at the checkpoint there.

## Chaos Anomaly
<Grid>
<Column>
Stack <Boon name="might"/> before the four *K1T-A golems* and kill them to spawn the Chaos Anomaly. Every 25%, she will become immune to damage and you have to kill K1T-A golems again to continue. Pay attention to the <Control name="knockback"/> from the small JT-12 golems and look out for *Flux Bombs*, the debuff can be hard to notice on the mosaic ground.

## Blizzard path (Forest)
You will need to enlighten four bonfires on the path to progress to the end boss, every player only has one *Enlighten* charge.    
You can stack <Effect name="stealth"/> to skip the mobs, but usually it is not needed. Do not assign a bonfire to each player, simply lighten them up as soon as you reach them.    
Learn to dodge the tentacle <Control name="knockback"/>s. Mobility skills and <Item id="49940"/> are very good here.

## Legendary Brazen Gladiator
<Grid>
<Column>
The end boss is only vulnerable when his protective bubble is removed by pulling him into the moving purple areas.    
He will also apply a group-wide <Control name="daze"/> if he hits anyone with the third hit of his auto-attack chain. Avoiding this is the highest priority during the fight. Either use blocks, dodges or invulnerables or simply do not stand in front of him when it hits. Learn to recognize the animation.

Starting at 50% health, he will randomly start a *pulling attack* which can be prevented by breaking his defiance bar. Save your crowd control skills for this.

Also, pay attention to the small JT-12 golems and their AoEs as they apply <Control name="knockback"/> and can shove you off the platform.
