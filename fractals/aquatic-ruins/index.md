## *or* Dolphin Path
Spam Skill 1 during swimming to reveal nearby hidden Krait and keep to the right. You can use Skill 2 to create a distraction and Skill 3 to get a short speed boost. Skill 5 can be used to instantly revive nearby dead allies. Always dodge **twice** when you anticipate a Krait attack. As soon as someone reaches the end boss, use <Command name="gg"/> to immediately resurrect there.
