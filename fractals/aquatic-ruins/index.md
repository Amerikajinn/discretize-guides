You can stack <Boon name="might"/> on the rack before entering the water. Kill the three groups of Krait and open the cages. Use `/gg` after the last cage to resurrect at the tunnel part.

<Tips>
    <Tip specialization="mesmer">Use <Skill id="10255"/> to group up Krait. You can place a <Skill id="10197"/> on the rack and open it with <Skill id="29578"/> underwater to not loose time while the others stack <Boon name="might"/>. You can place another one at the 2nd cage, swim ahead and open it at the 3rd cage. Place a <Skill id="10325"/> to give a speed bost the the whole party.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="warrior">Take <Skill id="14403"/> and trait <Trait id="1711"/> to grant <Boon name="fury"/> and <Boon name="might"/>, since the Druid can't get into <Skill id="33557"/> as often as on land.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="tempest">Retrait to Tempest for this fractal, as it is one of the best choices for underwater combat. Trait <Trait id="1503"/> to maximize dps.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="ranger">Retrait Druid to Marksmanship for <Trait id="986"/> and swap to <Trait id="965"/> in Nature Magic. Run five spirits (<Skill id="21773" text="false" size="24"/><Skill id="12497" text="false" size="24"/><Skill id="12493" text="false" size="24"/><Skill id="12498" text="false" size="24"/><Skill id="12569" text="false" size="24"/>) for easy boon application with <Trait id="1038"/>.</Tip>

## Dark Path

Swim together and take the *Luminous Plants* on the way to protect you and nearby players from dying. If you are able to survive it, take the shortcut to the left after entering the larger cave. Use dodges or <Effect name="invulnerability"/> for the last group of Krait. If someone reaches the end boss, use `/gg` to immediately resurrect there.
</Column>

<Column>
## *or* Dolphin Path

Spam `Skill 1` during swimming to reveal nearby hidden Krait and keep to the right. You can use `Skill 2` to create a distraction and `Skill 3` to get a short speed boost. `Skill 5` can be used to instantly revive nearby dead allies. Always dodge **twice** when you anticipate a Krait attack. As soon as someone reaches the end boss, use `/gg` to immediately resurrect there.

## <Boss red="true"/> Jellyfish Beast
<Grid>
<Column>
Pull the Jellyfish Beast to the electrified cage at the bottom by LoSing him to immediately break his defiance bar and deal more damage. If he eats you, use any kind of stunbreak to break free. Try to break his defiance bar as often as possible to benefit from <Item id="24868"/> and <Trait id="1502"/>.
