## Siegemaster Dulfy
Stack <Effect name="stealth"/> in the tent and run towards Dulfy. Focus the *Burning Oil* above her before walking below, control and cleave the trash mobs and utilize reflects and blocks while nuking her down. Destroy the gate after finishing her and gather on the other side of the wall.

<Tips>
    <Tip specialization="mesmer">Protect your party with <Skill id="29526"/> or <Skill id="10302"/> and control enemies with <Skill id="30359"/>. You can run <Trait id="751"/> for the entire fractal to grab more often and for even more reflects.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="elementalist">Cast <Skill id="5737"/>, <Skill id="5692"/> and <Skill id="5638"/> to destroy the Burning Oil above Dulfy.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="thief">Use the smoke field from <Skill id="13113"/> or <Skill id="14184"/> (also useful for reflects) or simply cast <Skill id="13117"/> to stack <Effect name="stealth"/>.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="guardian">Run <Skill id="9251"/> to reflect the projectiles.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="ranger">Use <Skill id="31568"/> from your Smokescale pet to stack <Effect name="stealth"/> at the beginning.</Tip>

## Courtyard
<Grid>
<Column>
To capture the courtyard, you have to kill (or kite away) four groups of *Veteran Ascalonians*. Be careful with pulling to little enemies.

As soon as you capture the courtyard, the *Fire Caller* will start a ritual and enemy groups spawn at the gates (clockwise starting north). Stay in the middle and wait for them to come to you. If you kill them too fast, they will respawn shortly (Bug).
</Column>

<Column>
<Tips>
    <Tip specialization="chronomancer"><Skill id="10363"/>, <Skill id="29526"/> and <Skill id="30359"/> are very valuable here.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="elementalist"><Skill id="5738"/> is very strong against the groups of mobs during the capture event.<br/>Stay in <Skill id="5492" text=false/> before Ashym for <Boon name="might"/> stacking.</Tip>
</Tips>
</Column>
</Grid>

## Captain Ashym
Stack <Effect name="might"/> while Captain Ashym runs towards you. Break his defiance bar as fast as possible and be careful with his *Meteor Shower* AoE skill. He also tends to block multiple times during the fight, stop wasting your skills in that case. At 25% health, he will equip a Fiery Greatsword and gain additional skills, just make sure to end the fight quickly.
