## Siegemaster Dulfy
Stack <Effect name="stealth"/> in the tent and run towards Dulfy. Focus the *Burning Oil* above her before walking below, control and cleave the trash mobs and utilize reflects and blocks while nuking her down. Destroy the gate after finishing her and gather on the other side of the wall.

    <Tip specialization="mesmer">Protect your party with <Skill id="29526" inline=true/> or <Skill id="10302" inline=true/> and control enemies with <Skill id="30359" inline=true/>. You can run <Trait id="751" inline=true/> for the entire fractal to grab more often and for even more reflects.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="elementalist">Cast <Skill id="5737" inline=true/>, <Skill id="5692"/> and <Skill id="5638"/> to destroy the Burning Oil above Dulfy.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="thief">Use the smoke field from <Skill id="13113"/> or <Skill id="14184"/> (also useful for reflects) or simply cast <Skill id="13117"/> to stack <Effect name="stealth"/>.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="guardian">Run <Skill id="9251"/> to reflect the projectiles.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="ranger">Use <Skill id="31568"/> from your Smokescale pet to stack <Effect name="stealth"/> at the beginning.</Tip>

## The Mossman
You can break his defiance bar while he is in <Effect name="stealth"/> to force a reveal, just do not waste all your cooldowns on him. If you need a <Command name="gg"/> to reset them, do it either before taking the Wisp at Bloomhunger or after activating him or you will bug the entire fractal and have to restart.

## Bloomhunger
<Grid>
<Column>
Activate the encounter by placing the nearby Wisp into an empty Wisp Cleft. Bloomhunger (and all trash mobs) are only vulnerable inside the active Wisp Cleft area, additionally all players gain 100% increased endurance regeneration from it. The active area switches clockwise, move to the next position as soon as it decreases in size.    
When Bloomhunger casts *Poison Rain*, immediately break his defiance bar (especially at the start of the fight) and nuke him to 75%/50%/25% life. Avoid his *Leap* and *Charge* attacks to prevent knockdowns.

### Spirit Onslaught *75%, 50%*
At 75% and 50% health, Bloomhunger will teleport to the middle and become immune to damage. You will have to kill trash mobs inside the active Wisp Cleft to make him vulnerable again. Keep your pets, illusions and spirits close to prevent mobs from getting stuck and kill the spawning Oakheart to avoid boredom. Do not waste your time on Oakhearts while Bloomhunger is vulnerable.    
Make sure to position yourself close to Bloomhunger before the phase ends to maximize the chance of him immediately jumping on you instead of charging around.

### Running the wisps *25%*
Try to position yourself before Bloomhunger reaches 25% health. Again, he will teleport to the middle and become immune, but this time you have to carry four Wisps from northwest, northeast, southeast and southwest to their associated empty Wisp Cleft in the center area within 30 seconds. If you are near a Wisp before the phase begins, you can easily carry two Wisps before the time expires.    
As soon as all four Wisp Clefts are activated, Bloomhunger gets vulnerable again and you can finish him off to complete the fractal.
