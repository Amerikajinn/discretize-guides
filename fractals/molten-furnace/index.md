Go to Rox and Braham, wait for the mobs to sapwn, kill them. After killing them, proceed into the tunnel, there are 5 caves in the tunnel, each having a group of mob in it, after killing the mobs, pick up the _Boulder_ that spawns and place it on top of the steam burst (a red gear indicates it's place). After killing all 5 group of mobs and placing all 5 _Boulders_ on the red gears you wait for the Drill to make it's way out of the tunnel.

## On your way to the Boss

<Grid>
<GridItem>  
You exit the tunnel and kill the group of mobs coming to you. Then proceed to the Steam Walls. The first Steam Wall is unpassable, each Steam Wall knocks you back and damage you. After the first, you can pass the following Steam Walls by walking backwards in them (do not walk into them with low hp, thats downs or even kills you). Make your way on to the weapon testing arena.

## Weapon Testing Arena <Label>Random</Label>

<Grid>
<GridItem>  
You enter the arena and survive the 3 weapon test, after you survived the second and third test a Molten Protector spawns, kill it before it gives the _Thermal Core_ <Effect name="invulnerability"/>. The weapon test types are in random order:

**Fire Tornadoes**

You have to dodge, block or reflect the Fire Tornadoes coming towards you, you can use the Thermal Core in the middle to your advantage. After surviving the test you can damage 25% of the _Thermal Core_.

**Shockwaves**

You have to dodge, block or jump over the shockwaves coming towards you. After surviving the test you can damage 25% of the _Thermal Core_.

**Fireball Barrage**

You have to avoid, block or reflect the Fire Barrage falling on you, a Mesmer can use <Skill id="10302"/> to reflect, the Druid can use <Skill id="31496"/> (Staff 5) in the middle of the AoE to absorb the projectile. After surviving the test you can damage 25% of the _Thermal Core_.

**At 25% and the boss after**

You have to damage the core as fast as possible since now all 3 weapon test types are active. After you killed the _Thermal Core_ the Weapons Test Engineer comes down. Kill him to finish the fractal.
