## Running the wisps
<Grid>
<Column>
Trigger the start event by walking to the three *Wisp Clefts* in the South. Wait for three players to be ready at each of the spawned Wisps, usually indicated by typing 'ready' in chat. Count down to go and deliver the Wisps to the Clefts within 30 seconds while avoiding <Condition name="stun"/>, <Condition name="immobile"/> and <Condition name="crippled"/> from the spike, wire and hunting traps on the ground.    
Learn and practice to jump over the emerging walls, for nearly every wall there is an easy spot to skip over it.    
The remaining two players can take the *Invigorator Rifle Prototypes* from the ground and use `Skill 3` to grant <Boon name="stability"/> to the Wisp runners. Note that it is possible to carry the Wisp from the farthest point without using any movement skills.    
If you are really desparate, you can download a [GW2 TacO](http://gw2taco.blogspot.de/) marker package for the traps from [here](http://discretize.eu/dl/FRACTALS_Swampland.xml).

<Tips>
    <Tip specialization="mesmer">You can place a <Skill id="10197" inline=true/> between a Wisp and the Clefts to instantly deliver it or place it in the middle of the map to make it easier for your comrades. Otherwise use <Skill id="10200" inline=true/> with <Skill id="29578" inline=true/> to cover your fails.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="warrior">Use <Skill id="14516" inline=true/> for better mobility.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="elementalist">Equip <Skill id="5536" inline=true/> for mobility and <Skill id="5507" inline=true/> for a condition cleanse.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="thief">Use <Skill id="13038" inline=true/> or <Skill id="13002" inline=true/> for fast delivery.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="guardian">Take <Skill id="9153" inline=true/> for party <Boon name="stability"/> and <Skill id="9084" inline=true/> for party <Boon name="swiftness"/> and <Boon name="aegis"/>. <Skill id="30083" inline=true/> is obviously very good to move faster.</Tip>

## The Mossman
You can break his defiance bar while he is in <Effect name="stealth"/> to force a reveal, just do not waste all your cooldowns on him. If you need a <Command name="gg"/> to reset them, do it either before taking the Wisp at Bloomhunger or after activating him or you will bug the entire fractal and have to restart.

## Bloomhunger
<Grid>
<Column>
Activate the encounter by placing the nearby Wisp into an empty Wisp Cleft. Bloomhunger (and all trash mobs) are only vulnerable inside the active Wisp Cleft area, additionally all players gain 100% increased endurance regeneration from it. The active area switches clockwise, move to the next position as soon as it decreases in size.    
When Bloomhunger casts *Poison Rain*, immediately break his defiance bar (especially at the start of the fight) and nuke him to 75%/50%/25% life. Avoid his *Leap* and *Charge* attacks to prevent knockdowns.

### Spirit Onslaught *75%, 50%*
At 75% and 50% health, Bloomhunger will teleport to the middle and become immune to damage. You will have to kill trash mobs inside the active Wisp Cleft to make him vulnerable again. Keep your pets, illusions and spirits close to prevent mobs from getting stuck and kill the spawning Oakheart to avoid boredom. Do not waste your time on Oakhearts while Bloomhunger is vulnerable.    
Make sure to position yourself close to Bloomhunger before the phase ends to maximize the chance of him immediately jumping on you instead of charging around.

### Running the wisps *25%*
Try to position yourself before Bloomhunger reaches 25% health. Again, he will teleport to the middle and become immune, but this time you have to carry four Wisps from northwest, northeast, southeast and southwest to their associated empty Wisp Cleft in the center area within 30 seconds. If you are near a Wisp before the phase begins, you can easily carry two Wisps before the time expires.    
As soon as all four Wisp Clefts are activated, Bloomhunger gets vulnerable again and you can finish him off to complete the fractal.
