## The Forgotten fortress

Prestack boons on the Mistlock Singularity nearby.

Kill the ghosts to start the encounter.

_Blast Black Peter_ the skeleton boss is kind of a dps race. He starts spawning way too many minions by the end of the encounter so you can wipe easily. He spawns mines which you can blow up with the cannon on top. The boss periodically gains <Boon name="Swiftness"/> <Boon name="Protection"/> and <Boon name="Stability"/> so removing it is priority and a key to kill him fast. He has a breakbar too so break that also helps.

### The treasures

Your object is simple. You need to collect 3 treasures in the treasure chest at the end of the cave. There will be moving AoEs spawning enemies if you move into it. If you touch the treasure, you will gain a debuff that slows you down significantly, to move the treasure fast, throw the item at each other moving towards the treasure chest.

## The Ship

<Grid>
<GridItem sm="6">
### Retrieve the second treasure

You need to get a chest again, now from one of the shores (random which one). Use same tactic as before, throw the chest across. There are 2 cannons each side of the ship, use it to clear mobs easily. After recovering the treasure the first mini boss spawns named _Mad Jack Squall_. During the boss there will be AoEs across the ship that blows players down the ship into the poisionous water. Kill him to start the next objective.

### Retrieve the third treasure
You need to get the chest once again from one of the shores. Use same tactic as before, throw the chest across. Use cannons to clear mobs.
After recovering the treasure the second mini boss spawns named _First Mate Calix_. During the boss there will be a new mechanic that spawns AoE on one player, place this AoE outside the fighting zone. The knockoff mechanic from Mad Jack Squall is present as well. Kill him to start the next objective.

It will be a point capture event, you need to stayalive long enough to kill all mobs coming from the two sides of the ship. Use the cannon to clear most of the ghosts. After the event is done, the main boss spawns.

### Anabella Crowe

Use `/gg` to reset mobs on the ship and use the Mistlock Singularity to stack boons. The two mechanics from before, the knockoff and AoE are present in this fight as well as a third one. It is an AoE placed on a player with a timer. If the circle fills, a huge damage is dealt to the player, but you can split up the damage between players, to counter this mechanic simply stack in the circle to split up the damage dealth to each player. The boss will be teleporting around as well as spawning mobs every 10% health of the boss. Kill her to finish the fractal.
