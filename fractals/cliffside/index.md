## Disclaimer
You will need an experienced Mesmer for this fractal or take double the time. The Mesmer should run <Skill id="10200"/>, <Skill id="29578"/>, <Skill id="10197"/>, <Skill id="10377"/> and <Trait id="752"/> until the end fight.

## Start & Ankle Seals
<Grid>
<Column>
Kill the Cultists but take the *Cultist Hammer* before finishing the last one to get a hammer charge.    
Take the portal to above (...or walk) and destroy the two *Ankle Seals* using hammer skill 4. Both sigils have to get hit two times, do not finish mobs unless you need a charge.    
Use <Command name="gg"/> afterwards and stay dead until the Mesmer reaches the Chest Seal.
</Column>

<Column>
<Tips>
    <Tip specialization="chronomancer">At the start, immediately blink forward and use <Effect name="stealth"/> to prevent aggro from the mobs. Place a <Skill id="10197"/>, walk upstairs while the others kill the mobs and open the portal in front of the *Ankle Seals*.<br/>Afterwards, wait at the gate for the others to finish the two seals, then rush ahead and use <Skill id="29578"/> with <Skill id="10200"/> to teleport twice <a href="/_/img/fractals/cliffside-1.jpg">here</a> and <a href="/_/img/fractals/cliffside-2.jpg">here</a> to reach the next level.<br/>Keep walking until you reach <a href="/_/img/fractals/cliffside-3.jpg">this board</a>, then <Command name="gg"/> as well.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="elementalist">Place a <Skill id="5516"/> for the Mesmer near the next corridor to speed things up.</Tip>

## Chest Seal
<Grid>
<Column>
As soon as the Mesmer did <Command name="gg"/> too, everyone can resurrect and will respawn in front of the *Chest Seal* with a new *Cultist Hammer* ahead of you.    
It will take five hits to break the seal. If you see your Mesmer running ahead and doing a portal to the *Arm Seals*, try to get a hammer charge before teleporting to above.
</Column>

<Column>
<Tips>
    <Tip specialization="chronomancer">After 2-3 hits against the Seal, place a <Skill id="10197"/>, use <Skill id="29578"/> with <Skill id="29830"/> and blink to <a href="/_/img/fractals/cliffside-4.jpg">this</a> and to <a href="/_/img/fractals/cliffside-5.jpg">this</a> spot. Run up to the *Right Arm Seal*, wait for the destruction of the *Chest Seal* and cast <Skill id="29578"/> again before opening the portal for the remaining party.</Tip>

## Arm Seals
<Grid>
<Column>
This is a matter of timing, so look out for the Mesmer and the hammer carrier. Ideally you have a charge left from below, then hit the *Right Arm Seal* once before killing the Veteran Cultist to gain another charge. Run to the *Left Arm Seal*.    
During the portal jumping, keep Cultist's health as low as possible but only finish them when a hammer charge is needed. If the Mesmer runs out of portals and more are needed, use a <Item id="78978"/>. Ideally, both seals take three hits to be destroyed.

Type <Command name="gg"/> after finishing both seals and stay dead. If you wipe before both seals are destroyed, they will reset to full health.
</Column>

<Column>
<Tips>
    <Tip specialization="chronomancer">Place a <Skill id="10197"/> at the *Right Arm Seal*. After walking to the *Left Arm Seal* together and hitting it, take the hammer and collect a charge before opening the portal. It is possible to hit the seals four times during one portal and destroy them both. Position the portal in front of the Seals and try to take it back during the <Control name="stun"/> after hitting a seal. You can use <Skill id="10200"/> as a stunbreak.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="warrior">You can take the *Cultist Hammer* and use <Skill id="21815"/> during the Portal jumping to nullify the high incoming damage.</Tip>
    <Tip specialization="ranger">Again, <Skill id="12638"/> from an offhand Axe helps pulling the Cultists to you.</Tip>

## Arch Diviner
<Grid>
<Column>
Do not resurrect yourself yet, wait for the Mesmer to finish his portal and do <Command name="gg"/> himself again or you will be stuck with an useless Mesmer for the entire end fight.

After the Mesmer indicates you to resurrect, take the portal to above and combat the Arch Diviner. His defiance bar appears very shortly but frequently, try to break it as often as possible to benefit from <Trait id="1502"/>.    
Every 25% of his health, you will need to collect *Cultist Hammer* charge similar to before by killing one of the four spawned Cultists and hit the final Seal once per phase. Cultists apply a lot of conditions so kill them fast and try to stay out of their aggro range.

Do not get caught in any of the Arch Diviner's voidzones, otherwise you will be teleported and trapped inside a distant cage which messes up positioning. Also, try to stack on him as he teleports to the furthermost person.
</Column>

<Column>
<Tips>
    <Tip specialization="chronomancer">After the whole party <Command name="gg"/>'ed, place a <Skill id="10197"/>, blink up to the Arch Diviner using <a href="/_/img/fractals/cliffside-6.jpg">this</a> spot, open the portal and do <Command name="gg"/> again to reset your cooldowns. Now the whole party can resurrect and use the portal, type 'go' in chat to indicate that.<br/>Before taking your own portal, switch your skills and traits back. This takes some timing to get right.<br/>**Update 25/07**: You can't take your own portal anymore (Bug: 'No line of sight'). Cast <Skill id="10200"/> again to follow your fellow party members to the top.<br/>At the Arch Diviner, you can <Skill id="10363"/> all four Cultists during the Seal phase to <a href="/_/img/fractals/cliffside-7.jpg">this</a> spot.</Tip>
