## Start
Before the start, you can put a <Item id="78978"/>, so you do not have to walk into the arena again after `/gg`.    
Aggro the mobs and stack them on the corner. The *Champion Inquest Technician* applies a group-wide <Control name="daze"/> with his stunning shield, use <Boon name="stability"/>, Blocks or invulnerables against it.    
After you killed the mobs, teleport into the arena, do `/gg` except the person with <Item id="78978"/>, after Mai Trin starts talking put down the portal, walk out of it (very important step, so you don't get Line of Sight bug) and do `/gg`. Use portal and the fight instantly starts.

## Mai Trin
<Grid>
<Column>
Mai Trin is protected by ten stacks of *Captain's Shield*, each stack reducing her incoming damage by 10%. The only way to remove stacks is by pulling her into electric fields from Horriks alternating projectiles. Standing in the electric field will remove one stack per second from her. The fire field projectile from Horrik can be reflected, absorbed.
The key is to stack on Mai Trin during the whole fight (beware the <Effect name="agony"/> from the instability), this way she will always be in an electric field, even if she teleports to the furthest player away. Due to the high incoming party damage, the Druid should be able to stay in <Skill id="31869"/> most of the time and keep the party alive, although the amount of conditions and damage in some phases may make it difficult to stay alive, resurrect your party members as soon as somebody gets down.

Every 25%, Mai Trin disappears and additional enemies will spawn while fiery cannons start shooting, here you have to phase Horrik to 75%,50%,25% (the additional cannon AoEs stay). Positioning is key, only move if needed. Keep focusing Mai Trin but cleave the mobs if possible.
