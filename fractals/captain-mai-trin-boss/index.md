## Mai Trin
<Grid>
<Column>
Mai Trin is protected by ten stacks of *Captain's Shield*, each stack reducing her incoming damage by 10%. The only way to remove stacks is by pulling her into electric fields from Horriks alternating projectiles. Standing in the electric field will remove one stack per second from her. The fire field projectile can be body-blocked. Do not waste your time damaging Horrik, as he will simply respawn if killed.    
The key is to stack on Mai Trin during the whole fight, this way she will always be in an electric field, even if she teleports to the furthest player away. Due to the high incoming party damage, the Druid should be able to stay in <Skill id="31869"/> most of the time and keep the party alive.

Every 25%, Mai Trin and Horrik disappear and fiery cannons start shooting at every ally. Only move if needed. Remember to stack on Mai Trins spawn position shortly before the cannon phase ends, as Horrik will immediately shoot an electric field projectile. After the last phase (at <25%) additional enemies will spawn. Keep focusing Mai Trin but cleave the mobs if possible. Note that you will not aggro the spawning sharpshooter in the western area if you stay east.
