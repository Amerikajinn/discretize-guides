The **<Specialization text="Hybrid Renegade" name="Renegade"/>** (also **_Alacrity Renegade_** or **_Support Renegade_**) is the ideal counterpart to <Specialization text="Hybrid Firebrand" name="Firebrand"/> as it provides permanent <Boon name="alacrity"/> for the group.

Furthermore the build offers great DPS support with <Trait name="Assassins Presence"/> and <Skill name="Soulcleaves Summit"/>. <Boon name="might"/> is easily taken care off with <Skill name="Heroic Command"/>. If you group really lacks <Boon name="might"/> and/or <Boon name="fury"/> (for example missing a <Specialization name="Weaver"/>), consider taking <Item id="24702"/>.

<Skill name="Surge of the Mists"/> is currently the strongest CC skill on huge hitboxes left in the game. Combined with <Skill name="Darkrazors Daring"/>, you can single-handedly erase a big part of defiance bars in challenge modes.

Please note that the build variant below is optimized for 100% boon duration. While in theory, 78% is enough to provide permanent <Boon name="Alacrity"/>, fractals are not a golem - more boon duration helps greatly when the party needs to move or split for intermediate phases. Another beneficial side effect is better <Boon name="Might"/> uptime.

<Card title="Skill Usage">
The general list of priorities looks like this:

- Grant <Boon name="Alacrity"/> to your allies by using <Skill name="Orders from Above"/> near them whenever it's ready
- Provide group <Boon name="Might"/> with <Skill name="Heroic Command"/> when it's below 25 stacks
- Break defiance bars with <Skill name="Surge of the Mists"/>
- Maximize <Skill name="Soulcleaves Summit"/> uptime on the group
- Spam 111 on Sword (using anything else is usually a party DPS loss)

You'll always want to use <Skill id="41858"/> as your first legend:

- <Skill name="Breakrazors Bastion"/> is a strong group heal
- <Skill name="Darkrazors Daring"/> is a slow but strong CC
- <Skill name="Soulcleaves Summit"/> is a really strong group DPS buff, use it shortly before defiance bars break

For most fractals the <Boon name="stability"/> and defensive options of <Skill id="28419"/> are great, so that's going to be your second legend most of the time:

- <Skill name="Inspiring Reinforcement"/> pulses group <Boon name="Stability"/>
- <Skill name="Forced Engagement"/> deals 250 defiance bar damage with 2 seconds of <Condition name="Taunt"/> and <Condition name="Slow"/>
- <Skill name="Vengeful Hammers"/> is your DPS option in this legend
- <Skill name="Rite of the Great Dwarf"/> reduces incoming group damage by 50%, great when you expect high incoming damage

If <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/>, <Instability name="Vengeance"/> or other sources of boons on enemies are present you will want to take <Skill id="28494"/> as your second legend:

- <Skill name="Pain Absorption"/> applies <Boon name="resistance"/> and acts as a stunbreak
- <Skill name="Banish Enchantment"/> strips three boons on up to five targets

If nothing of the above applies you can use <Skill id="28134"/> as its the highest DPS option with <Skill name="Impossible Odds"/>.

Notes about other weapon skills:

- <Skill id="28472"/> (Sword 4) is good for instant <Condition name="vulnerability"/> and counts as 5 hits to get up Kalla's Fervor for <Skill name="Heroic Command"/>
- <Skill id="29233"/> (Sword 2) is a DPS increase over auto-attacking if you have spare energy
- Same goes for <Skill name="Citadel Bombardment"/> (F2) on large hitboxes
- <Skill name="Renewing Wave"/> (Staff 4) is a small party heal & condition cleanse and blast finisher
