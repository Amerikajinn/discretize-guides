As a good complimentary build to the <Specialization name="reaper" prefix="Condition"/> one, the <Specialization name="Scourge" prefix="Condition"/> excels at providing supplementary defensive support abilities for a group whilst still going full damage, as well as superior area damage to its <Specialization name="reaper" prefix="Condition"/> counterpart. Because both builds are so similar in terms of their equipment (minus infusions) it allows for an experienced Necromancer player to swap between the two on the fly as a situation requires it. 

Scourge has a simplistic "rotation" in that you have less skills overall to use, but it is counterbalanced by the need to "maintain" parts of your kit for your damage output to excel; namely keeping up two sand shades, using punishment skill in tandem with said shades and maintaining life force to allow for use of your Shroud skills.

If you keep on top of this, <Specialization name="Scourge" prefix="Condition"/> can also adapt itself to utilize tools to assist a team, be it a requirement for more condi cleanses, barriers, portals, boon corruption, etc; with all of this packed into a build that will not have its damage disrupted should the group be forced out of melee range.

This build is recommended for situations where boon corruption may be needed for the team, extra forms of projectile mitigation are required, or if large scale cleaving damage via <Skill id="10606"/> is desired (and can also allow you to solo/carry most fractals should you gain enough mastery over it).

Swap Weapons
</CardHeader>
<CardContent>
You can also run <Item id="44944"/> instead of <Item id="24605"/> if you are heavily using <Skill id="10606"/> for an encounter. You also don't need to weapon swap if you run <Item id="44944"/>. Can run a Dagger for more condi cleanse, or a Warhorn for more CC (for the former geomancy is fine but for Warhorn you would just run bursting). 

(Placing your Scepter and Torch in your weapon slots as shown above will allow you to weaponswap despite only having one torch).
