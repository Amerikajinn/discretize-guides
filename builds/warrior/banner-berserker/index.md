The <Specialization text="Banner Berserker" name="berserker"/> is the strongest build for <Specialization name="warrior"/> in fractals, provided at least one of the following is true:

1. Your group will be able to break all necessary defiance bars near instantly without core Warrior’s fast recharging Skull Crack, or Rampage.
2. Your group will be able to maintain 25 <Boon name="Might"/> without <Trait name="Phalanx Strength"/>.

Besides providing the group with strong unique damage buffs in <Skill name="Banner of Strength"/> and <Skill name="Banner of Discipline"/> and having excellent single defiance bar damage in <Skill name="Tremor"/> and <Skill name="Headbutt"/>, the build also has relatively high burst and excellent sustained damage.

Furthermore, the build is able to use damage modifying sigils like <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/> as well as slaying potions such as <Item name="Powerful Potion of Slaying Scarlets Armies"/>. As a <Specialization text="Banner Berserker" name="berserker"/>, your focus is to maintain your unique party buffs and instantly contribute to breaking defiance bars, all the while making DPS players sweat nervously when they glance at their DPS meter.

<Card title="Situational">
If the group finds itself lacking <Boon name="Might"/>, you can replace <Skill name="Signet of Might"/> with <Skill name="For Great Justice!"/>, or if only a little CC is required, replace <Skill name="Headbutt"/> with <Skill name="Battle Standard"/>.

If the group finds itself lacking CC, you can replace <Skill name="Signet of Might"/> with <Skill name="Wild Blow"/>. If CC is still short, it may be worthwhile swapping to <Specialization text="Banner Warrior" name="warrior"/>. Slow defiance bars leading to longer phases and potential might issues should be avoided if you can do anything about it.

For bosses with longer phases such as Ensolyss or Arkk, consider replacing <Trait name="Savage Instinct"/> with <Trait name="Smash Brawler"/> to improve berserk uptime.

For boss fights such as the Brazen Gladiator in the Chaos Fractal, with no initial defiance bar or phases, consider to play <Trait name="Smash Brawler"/>, <Skill name="Outrage"/>, <Skill name="Blood Reckoning"/>.

<Card title="Skill usage">
**Pre-fight:**
* Use both charges of <Skill name="For Great Justice!"/>. 
* Swap to <Trait id="1711"/> and use <Skill id="14355"/>. Swap back to your initial traits.
* If a fire field isn’t present, equip an offhand torch and use <Skill name="Flames of War"/>.
* If you haven’t needed to precast your banners at the boss, use them to blast the fire field for 6 stacks of <Boon name="Might"/> per banner.
* If you have precast your banners, use <Skill name="Call of Valor"/> and <Skill id="14393"/> on offhand warhorn to blast four times using the _Mistlock Singularity_.
* Cast <Skill name="Mending"/> immediately before the boss becomes vulnerable.
* If there is a defiance bar present immediately at the start of the fight, start on your Mace/Mace set - otherwise swap to it when necessary.
* With <Item name="Paralyzation" type="Sigil"/> you can deal 820 defiance bar damage with
    * <Skill name="Tremor"/>, you can precast it and cancel the aftercast animation
    * <Skill name="Pommel Bash"/>
    * <Skill name="Headbutt"/> 

**DPS:**
* Camp Axe/Axe if no CC is required.
* You need three critical hits to regain an <Skill name="decapitate"/>. You should get three <Skill name="decapitate"/> before pressing <Skill name="Whirling axe"/>.
* It is key that you are in <Skill name="Berserk"/> mode for as many burn phases as possible for maximum DPS. Pay attention to your groups phase times and your <Skill name="Berserk"/> extensions. It is better for <Skill name="Berserk"/> to drop when the boss isn’t stunned if that means it will be back up right before another burst window.

<Card title="Damage modifiers">
* Entering <Skill name="Berserk"/> grants 3 stacks of <Trait name="Berserkers Power"/>, while <Skill name="Decapitate"/> only grants 1. You will find <Trait name="Berserkers Power"/> starting to run low when out of <Skill name="Berserk"/>, try to make sure you are in <Skill name="Berserk"/> for burn phases while also not delaying <Skill name="Berserk"/> where possible.
* Casting <Skill name="Mending"/> for <Trait name="Peak Performance"/> is only a DPS gain if you can’t be hitting something else, use it right before the start of DPS phases but only use it during if you need the heal.
* With 100% critical chance, <Trait name="Axe mastery"/>, and <Skill name="Berserk"/>, it will take 3 hits to charge <Skill name="Decapitate"/>. Combine <Skill name="Cyclone Axe"/> / <Skill name="Double Chop"/> with <Skill name="Throw Axe"/> or a single auto-attack. Only use <Skill name="Throw Axe"/> outside <Skill name="Berserk"/> to prevent its ammo count fully recharging.
* Interrupting your auto-attack chain to use <Skill name="Decapitate"/> or enter <Skill name="Berserk"/> is a DPS increase. Keep in mind that <Skill name="Crushing Blow"/> inflicts 15x  <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> if your party is running low, and can often be used with no DPS loss if you are on your mace set waiting to CC.

<Tabs outlined>
<Tab title="MAMA">
**General**

Help pre-stacking at Mistlock Singularity with <Skill name="Charge" profession="Warrior"/> and <Skill name="Call of Valor" profession="Warrior"/>. It is highly encouraged to go core warrior for CC. You can stay berserker if you are willing to counter the lack of cc with consumables or you are in a team with CC spreadsheets.

### **Organized <Specialization name="berserker"/>** (Standard Axe/Axe Axe/Mace)

You can precast banners with the help of a <Item id="44642"/> if you expect a ~55s kill. Open the portal on the slope (not at the flat area around the mistlock, but before), hop in, precast the banners and take your portal back. You are now free to run the dps setup for short fights:

<Skill name="blood reckoning"/>, <Skill name="outrage"/>, <Skill name="Throwbolas"/> <Skill name="Signet of might"/> and <Skill name="headbutt"/>. Remember to swap to <Trait id="2049"/>. 

**Opening**

If you are using  <Trait id="2049"/>, open with <Skill name="tremor"/> and <Skill name="whirlingaxe"/>.  
Else <Skill name="tremor"/> followed by <Skill name="headbutt"/>.

---

### **PuG <Specialization name="Warrior"/>** (Standard Axe/Axe Mace/Mace)

Start MAMA on Mace/Mace. Instantly break MAMA's Defiance bar using <Skill id="14402"/>, <Skill name="Tremor" profession="Warrior"/>, <Skill name="Pommel Bash" profession="Warrior"/>, <Skill name="Skull Crack" profession="Warrior"/> (if <Skill id="14502"/> won't break MAMA's Defiance bar use <Item id="8664"/>, <Item id="8677"/> and <Item id="8749"/>), <Skill id="14502"/> and continue with standard rotation on Axe/Axe.

Fast Hands allows you to quickly adapt to what is currently needed in the encounter and consumables like <Item id="8664"/>, <Item id="8677"/> and <Item id="8749"/>.

Keep an eye on MAMA's <Condition name="vulnerability"/> stacks and use <Skill name="crushing blow" profession="Warrior"/> if it runs low.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Siax">
**General**

Help pre-stacking at Mistlock Singularity with <Skill name="Charge" profession="Warrior"/> and <Skill name="Call of Valor" profession="Warrior"/>. 

**Organized**

You can precast banners with the help of a <Item id="44642"/> if you expect a ~55s kill. Open the portal on the slope (not at the flat area around the mistlock, but before), hop in, precast the banners and take your portal back. You are now free to run the dps setup for short fights:

<Skill name="blood reckoning"/>, <Skill name="outrage"/>, <Skill name="Throwbolas"/> <Skill name="Signet of might"/> and <Skill name="headbutt"/>. Remember to swap to <Trait id="2049"/>. 

Things to keep in mind:
- Use <Skill name="Whirling Axe"/> to gain Adrenalin and engage <Skill name="Berserk"/> as soon as possible. 
- Use <Skill name="Headbutt"/> to CC and break the stun with <Skill name="Outrage"/>. Use this combo asap to keep up <Skill name="Berserk"/>. 
- Use <Skill name="Throw Bolas"/> before casting <Skill name="Whirling Axe"/> to maximize dps. 
- Use <Skill name="Blood reckoning"/> on cooldown.
- Use a Rifle to kill your add without loosing time. Use <Skill name="gunflame"/>, <Skill name="volley"/> and a couple autos to get the job done. A greatsword also works out great.


**Annotations:**
- If additional Defiance bar damage is needed make use of <Item id="8664"/>, <Item id="8677"/> and <Item id="8749"/>. 
- Kill your add as fast as possible and return to the boss. You do not wanna miss the time the boss is invulnerable or your dps will suffer. 
- Keep an eye on Siax's <Condition name="vulnerability"/> stacks and use <Skill name="crushing blow" profession="Warrior"/> if it runs low.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Ensolyss">
This is one of the fights, where berserker shines bright. As soon as you do not instabreak CC it makes sense to play <Specialization name="Warrior"/>. 

### **<Specialization name="Berserker"/>** (Standard Axe/Axe Mace/Mace)
Berserker is really strong on this encounter, because your <Skill name="Berserk"/> perfectly aligns with phase durations. There are some interesting weapon choices: if your team manages CC you can take an offhand torch for more dps. Remember to swap back to <Trait id="1977"/>. 

**Opening:**
- <Skill name="Mending"/> when he appears
- <Skill name="Tremor"/> start to cast a few milliseconds before he looses <Effect name="invulnerability"/>
- <Skill name="Headbutt"/>
- <Skill name="Berserk"/>

**66% and 33%**

Pick up your banners and swap to your off set (mace/torch). After everyone capped their circle, try to blast a fire field with your banners. Then go on:
- <Skill name="crushingblow"/>
- <Skill name="Mending"/>
- <Skill name="Tremor"/> 
- <Skill name="Headbutt"/>
- <Skill name="Berserk"/>

---

### **<Specialization name="Warrior"/>** (Standard Axe/Axe Mace/Mace)

Begin the encounter on Axe/Axe with <Skill id="14402"/>, <Skill id="14502"/>, <Skill name="Eviscerate" profession="Warrior"/>, <Skill name="Whirling Axe" profession="Warrior"/>, <Skill name="Dual Strike" profession="Warrior"/>, <Skill name="Throw Axe" profession="Warrior"/>, <Skill name="Cyclone Axe" profession="Warrior"/> and immediately swap to Mace/Mace to break Ensolyss's Defiance bar with <Skill name="Tremor" profession="Warrior"/>, <Skill name="Pommel Bash" profession="Warrior"/> and <Skill name="Skull Crack" profession="Warrior"/>.

Once Ensolyss's
Defiance bar is broken continue with standard rotation on Axe/Axe. At 66% and 33% swap to Mace/Mace and capture one of the five altars.

As soon as Ensolyss returns attack with <Skill name="Mace Smash" profession="Warrior"/>, <Skill name="Mace Bash" profession="Warrior"/> and <Skill name="Pulverize" profession="Warrior"/> until the Defiance bar appears.

Immediately use <Skill name="Tremor" profession="Warrior"/>, <Skill name="Skull Crack" profession="Warrior"/> (if <Skill id="14502"/> won't break Ensolyss's Defiance bar use <Item id="8664"/>, <Item id="8677"/> and <Item id="8749"/>), <Skill id="14502"/> and continue standard rotation until the second Defiance bar appears. Break it with <Skill name="Pommel Bash"/>, <Skill name="Skull Crack" profession="Warrior"/> and <Item id="8664"/>, <Item id="8677"/>, <Item id="8749"/>, <Skill id="14502"/> and resume standard rotation.

Keep an eye on <Condition name="vulnerability"/> stacks and use <Skill name="crushing blow" profession="Warrior"/> if it runs low.

- If your party is not the fastest pick up your banners and redrop them on the main island. Put them slightly outside of the stack so you don't take a portal on accident.

**Islands**
- Swap to your warhorn or torch if you have it and use the blasts in firefields for <Boon name="might"/>.

- On the last island shortly before the add dies use <Skill name="Mending"/> and open <Skill name="Berserk"/> already.

**66%-33%**
- Follow the standard fractal rotation.
- If your party does not phase Skorvald without a dash, recast your banners.

<Tab title="Artsariiv">
**General**  

If you run with a decent <Specialization name="soulbeast"/>, burn phases won't last long and your dps will be not be that cool, you have to focus on getting the banner placement right.

**Build variation**  
- Standard is Axe-Axe Mace-Mace
- Depending on the instabilities it can make sense to bring <Skill name="BerserkerStance"/>

**Prestacking**
- Drop a fire field with <Skill name="Flames of war"/>.
- Use <Skill name="For great justice"/> as soon as you see <Skill name="Moa stance"/> on your bar.
- Blast with <Skill name="Charge" profession="Warrior"/> and <Skill name="Call of Valor" profession="Warrior"/>.
- Blast 12 Stacks of might with <Skill name="Banner of Strength"/> and <Skill name="Banner of Discipline"/>.
- Take the mistlock.
- While approaching the boss drop both of your banners. Depending on your group DPS you either place them in the middle or at the corner.
- Precast <Skill name="Flames of war"/> for dps
- Precast <Skill name="Mending"/>

**100% in mid**

- Use <Skill name="whirling axe"/> or <Skill name="Headbutt"/> to gain adrenalin fast.
- Depending on your team you wanna engage <Skill name="Berserk"/> before you use your special action key to get to Artsariiv. 
- Use <Skill name="Mending"/> to regain eventually lost health and <Trait name="peakperformance"/>. 
- Swap to your mace, be ready to <Skill id="14415"/> as soon as the breakbar appears.

**66% and 33%**

Pick up your banners and place them in the middle of the arena. Help your party to cc the adds, preferable by getting rid of the one in the middle, since you are there anyway. Replace your banners at the corner Artsariiv is going to jump to.

</Tab>
<Tab title="Arkk">
Usually the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> is responsible for slaying the Temmporal Anomaly, nonetheless pay close attention to it and assist if necessary. Dont forget to use `Nova Launch` to circumvent the effects of Arkk's _Solar Fury_ and _Solar Discharge_.

**Precast**

Use a <Item id="78978"/>, use special action key to get to the platform and precast <Skill id="14405"/>, <Skill id="14407"/>, <Skill id="14408"/> and a <Skill id="14419"/>. Take the portal back.

Help pre-stacking at Mistlock Singularity with <Skill name="Charge" profession="Warrior"/> and <Skill name="Call of Valor" profession="Warrior"/>. Do not take the mistlock to early or you will need more than 1-2 hits to fill up your adrenalin. Also before taking the mistlock precast <Skill name="mending"/>.

**Bloom phases**

If you are full hp, you can step into the lightning, auto attack your bloom until it gets pushed towards the pillar. Use a <Skill name="Throw axe"/> to finish your add. Use <Skill name="Mending"/> afterwards to regain health.

**Add phases**

Refresh your <Skill id="14405"/> and <Skill id="14407"/> at the archdiviner and gladiator adds by blasting a firefield.
