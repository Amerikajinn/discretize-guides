<Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> is a DPS build with very high burst damage that also provides strong party buffs with <Skill name="Frost Spirit"/> and <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/>, some <Condition name="Vulnerability"/> and crowd control (CC) skills. Furthermore, <Skill name="Whirling Defense"/> is an exceedingly strong reflect skill that comes in handy on several encounters (e.g. Artsariiv).

For prestacking and encounters where the <Specialization name="Firebrand"/> plays <Specialization name="Dragonhunter"/> or <Specialization name="Guardian"/>, it is beneficial to bring <Skill name="moa stance"/> to extend the uptime of boons, especially <Boon name="Quickness"/>. The Guide and CM tabs provide more information.

The build benefits from slaying potions such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

It can be easier to use a ring with 3 <Item id="49438"/> in order to reach 245 Agony Resistance so you can share 1 ring between <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> and <Specialization name="Weaver"/> and use full zerk on both.

<Card title="Skirmishing and Fractals">
Running Skirmishing in fractals is quite a niche choice, you need to satisfy **both of the following requirements:**
- You can be sure that you can flank the boss permanently.
- You want to replace a <Specialization name="Berserker"/> by providing your team with <Trait name="Spotter"/> so they can crit cap.

If both of these requirements then you can swap Marksmanship for Skirmishing with the following trait setup:

<Card title="Guide">
The main idea of <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> (as with all classes) is to ensure you get as much damage into the <Effect name="Exposed"/> buff. As your largest damage skill you want to ensure that <Skill name="Whirling Defense"/> under the effects of <Skill name="Sicem"/> is your first priority when you see <Effect name="Exposed"/> on the boss. 

Also as <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> you have quite a few ticking damage over time AoEs, such as <Skill name="Barrage"/> and <Skill name="Frost Trap"/> (as well as <Skill id="5531"/> if you have <Skill id="5516"/> from your <Specialization name="Weaver"/>). You want to precast these AoEs where possible when you know that the boss is about to be <Effect name="Exposed"/>. 

In PuGs, however, it is quite hard to predict when the boss will be CCed as well as phases can last a lot longer than expected, because of this the golem rotation is listed to the right so that you can resort back to it if you end up in a longer phase.

**Weapon Skills:**
- **You should mostly run main-hand sword as it offers higher burst potential than dagger in all situations.** It also offers nice movement skills: <Skill name="Monarchs leap"/> and <Skill name="Hornet sting"/>.
- You may take main-hand axe (to fill with <Skill name="wintersbite"/>) for certain encounters, such as midburn Artsariiv, where you almost never autoattack with your dual wielding weapons set.
- As a <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> you want to always run offhand axe as it grants you access to <Skill name="Whirling Defense"/>, your highest damage skill, as well as <Skill id="12638"/>, a useful pull skill for adds.

For your second weapon set you either run greatsword or longbow:
 
- Longbow is a default pick for fractal <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> as it has a higher burst potential through the ability to precast <Skill name="Barrage"/> which is high damage ticking AoE, however you will end up with lower damage if your phases are too long since its auto attacks are very weak. Longbow synergizes well with <Item id="84505"/> which you can proc for a nice damage bonus. 
- Greatsword on the other side offers great sustained DPS. You need to be smart about utilizing the <Effect name="attackofopportunity"/> effect that you gain from <Skill id="12525"/>. Finally, you also have <Skill name="Counterattack"/> which is a handy block in certain scenarios.
- In order to proc <Item id="84505"/> you merely need to use any CC skill (such as <Skill id="45743"/> or <Skill id="12511"/>) whilst the enemy is using an ability.

**Pets:**
- For pets you simply run <Skill id="43636" disableText/> [Rock Gazelle](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Juvenile_Rock_Gazelle) if you need CC or <Skill id="44617" disableText/> [Red Moa](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Juvenile_Red_Moa) if you don't. **It is safer to just run Gazelle most of the time and only swap to Moa when you are sure you don't need the CC. You never know when a little CC can come in handy!**
- You want to have <Skill id="31568" disableText/> [Smokescale](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Juvenile_Smokescale) on swap to have quick access if you need stealth for skips at any point.

**Utility Skills:**
- **You should never swap out <Skill name="Frost spirit"/> or <Skill name="OneWolfPack"/> as they are both massive damage buffs both personally and for the team!**
- You want to always run <Skill name="Sicem"/> as it grants you a **40% damage bonus** for its duration. One thing to keep in mind is that it only grants you a 40% damage bonus against the foe you use it on, so if you are cleaving trash mobs it might not be worth using. Secondly, you only get the buff if you are in <Skill id="42944"/> so also don't activate it if you are unmerged. 
- Your default second utility is <Skill name="Signet of the wild"/> which is a nice passive stat increase. Depending on the situation you can instead run <Skill name="Frost trap"/> which offers higher burst potential. The situations when you want to run trap depend upon phase length and downtime on phases where the trap can recharge.
  - For example on Skorvald you can use <Skill name="Frost trap"/> at the start of each phase into <Effect name="Exposed"/> since it recharges during the island phase so the trap is an obvious pick over signet.
- Most healing skills on ranger are quite useful: <Skill name="We heal as one"/> is a large heal and extends the boons on yourself thanks to <Skill id="42944"/>. Secondly <Skill name="Bear stance"/> is a great condi cleanse either personally or for your team. Finally <Skill name="Troll unguent"/> is a ticking heal that can be useful for pushing orbs at Arkk to enter the damage field.

**Extra Notes:**
- <Trait name="Essence of speed"/> in combination with <Trait name="Live fast"/> means that using <Skill name="Worldly impact"/> extends your boons, this can be helpful in Ensolyss split phase to maintain boons on yourself. The healing skill <Skill name="We heal as one"/> also allows you to extend boons on yourself.
- <Skill name="Quickening Zephyr"/> in combination with the <Item id="85244"/> allows you to move extremely fast and is useful for a few skips. Check the [Fractal Guides](/fractals) for specific skips.

If you have a Mistlock Singularity present you can use this rotation
1. If a fire field isn’t present, equip an offhand torch and use <Skill id="12504"/>.
2. <Skill name="Moa Stance"/> with <Trait name="Leader of the Pack"/>.
3. `Optional` Use <Skill id="12537"/> then change back the utility that it was in place of.
3. <Skill id="12621"/> to blast might.
4. <Skill id="31914"/> to extend your boons.
5. Pick up <Skill id="5516"/> if there is one.
6. <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/> then take the Mistlock and trigger the boss.

If you don't have Mistlock Singularity present you can use this simplified rotation:
1. If a fire field isn’t present, equip an offhand torch and use <Skill id="12504"/>.

3. <Skill id="12621"/> to blast might.
4. <Skill id="31914"/> to extend your boons.
5. Pick up <Skill id="5516"/> if there is one.

<Card title="Underwater Guide">

For a DPS rotation the same rules apply as above land, try to fit lots of damage into <Skill name="Sicem"/> and <Skill name="One wolf pack"/>. You want to start on Harpoon gun and use <Skill id="12528"/> and <Skill name="Mercy Shot"/> to precast damage into <Skill name="Sicem"/>. Outside of that precasting, you want to camp Spear since <Skill name="Man o war"/>, <Skill name="Swirling Strike"/> as well as your auto-attack chain deal good damage. You should swap back to Harpoon gun at the start of the split-phase of the Jellyfish Beast to range the split adds as well as allowing you to restart your rotation when the split-phase ends.

Underwater the pet you use for DPS depends on the situation just like above land:
- You want to merge with <Skill id="44514" disableText/> [Tiger](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Juvenile_Tiger) for DPS as well as <Boon name="Fury"/> uptime. You want to use <Skill id="40625"/> and <Skill name="Worldly impact"/> for DPS on Tiger, additionally during DPS downtime (The split phase of the Jellyfish Beast) you want to unmerge and use <Skill id="31451"/> to help your teams <Boon name="Fury"/> uptime.
- If you don't need the <Boon name="Fury"/> uptime then you can consider using <Skill id="43068" disableText/> [Lashtail Devourer](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Juvenile_Lashtail_Devourer) as a DPS pet. You want to use <Skill name="Worldly impact"/> for DPS as well as <Skill id="43068"/> off cd so that you proc <Trait name="Twice as Vicious"/> for a nice 10% damage bonus.
- Finally when you want to move around very fast then you can merge with <Skill id="42797" disableText/> [Shark](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Juvenile_Shark) for mobility. You simply use <Skill id="42797"/> to move around. **Be careful when you swap pets since you can no longer pet swap in combat!**

**Bonus Tips:**
- <Skill name="Bear stance"/> in combination with <Trait name="leader of the pack"/> can be quite helpful to cleanse conditions on allies since [Aquatic Ruins](/fractals/aquatic-ruins) often has <Instability name="Afflicted"/>. 
- If you know that a blockable attack is coming then be sure to use <Skill name="Counterstrike"/> since you can proc <Trait name="Twice as Vicious"/> for a nice 10% damage bonus.
