<Specialization name="Daredevil" text="Power Daredevil"/> has great sustained DPS,  great burst on stacked trash mobs, good  single target burst, brings excellent crowd control and offers  <Effect name="stealth"/>, which paired with top tier mobility thanks to <Skill id="13025"/>, <Skill id="13002"/> and <Skill id="13064"/>  can provide many skips. Thief has very simplistic rotation, which makes it fairly easy to play, but due to initiative and energy managament, thief becomes quite hard to master.

In fractals thief may fall behind, becouse of few factors. First would be <Trait id="1268"/> nature, which forces thief to  constantly attack from behind or flank, which in some cases is very hard to do. Next would be <Trait id="1257"/>, which may sometimes not utilise its full potential in 5 man groups. Finally keep in mind that becouse of <Trait id="2047"/>, u may be pushing your teammates on fractals with <Instability name="Social awkwardness"/> instability, into deadly zones.



The build benefits from slaying potions such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

<Card title="Tips">
Basicly <Skill id="30597"/> is worth using if you can hit 4+ mobs at once. So on stacked trash packs, its worth to just spam <Skill id="30597"/> and finish with <Skill id="13085"/>.

<Skill id="13041"/> is amazing shortbow skill. Its blast with low initiative cost. Use it to blast <Boon name="Might"/> and   <Effect name="Stealth"/> with fire and smoke fields. 

Keep in mind you can precast skills like <Skill id="13037"/>, <Skill id="13082"/> or <Skill id="13132"/> and take mistlock singularity to refresh colddown. For example u can do something like: precast <Skill id="13082"/>, take mistlock, cast <Skill id="13132"/>, and swap to <Skill id="13082"/> again.

Even tho thief doesn't have access to  <Boon name="Superspeed"/> or <Boon name="Quickness"/> for  <Item id="85244"/> or <Item id="49940"/>, it still can provide many skips, for your party.
