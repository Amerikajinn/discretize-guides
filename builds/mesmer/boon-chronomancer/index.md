Yes, you've read correctly - the <Specialization text="Boon Chronomancer" name="chronomancer"/> or <Specialization text="Chaos Chronomancer" name="chronomancer"/> is capable of providing **every single boon** in the game to the party. You can permanently keep up ten boons plus <Boon name="aegis"/> and some <Boon name="resistance"/> which has great synergy with your own trait <Trait id="1865"/>, the <Specialization name="warrior"/>'s <Trait id="1471" profession="warrior"/> and the <Specialization name="weaver" text="Arcane Weaver"/>'s <Trait id="1511" profession="elementalist"/>.

This is the recommended build if you plan on playing **without a <Specialization name="druid"/> and a third DPS instead**, as one additional <Trait id="264" profession="elementalist"/> is enough to keep up 25x <Boon name="might"/> in combination with your own might output - making <Skill id="31582" profession="ranger"/>, <Skill id="12497" profession="ranger"/> and <Trait id="1016" profession="ranger"/> (redundant with <Trait id="2177" profession="elementalist"/> in fractals) the only loss while you gain much more DPS. The slow ramp-up time for <Boon name="might"/> is compensated by pre-stacking.

On top of the aforementioned, the build has access to the usual mesmer utilities being <Skill id="10197"/> and <Effect name="stealth"/> skips, strong reflects, boon stripping and amazing crowd control skills such as <Skill id="29519"/>.

While the sheer amount of possibilities are nice to look at, the Chronomancer is one of the harder builds to play as the skills require timing and good dynamic decision-making.

Note that you can also run an Offhand Sword instead of Staff for better DPS. It's still possible to achieve 100% <Boon name="retaliation"/> uptime on stationary fights with Sword but Staff is overall the safer option with more <Boon name="aegis"/> uptime, as your only other source is <Trait id="670"/> without it.

<Divider text="Healing Variant"/>

The **Healing Variant** can be used if your party has trouble surviving without a dedicated healer. Note that using full Minstrel equipment, 6x <Item id="24842"/>, <Trait id="1865"/> and <Item id="79722"/> puts you above 100% Boon Duration already - no <Item id="72339"/> needed. You can replace Minstrel with Cleric items for even more Healing Power if you have additional Concentration (like from having more Agony Resistance).

Your main heal sources are <Trait id="1915"/>, <Trait id="740"/>, <Trait id="1987"/>, <Boon name="regeneration"/> and your heal skill. Keep in mind that <Trait id="757"/> is a strong condition cleanse combined with <Skill id="10213"/> charges. If you have <Trait id="738"/> traited, you can use up mantra charges as the preparation itself heals already as well.

| <Skill id="34326" size="big" disableText/> | One of the strongest reflect skills, protecting everyone inside from projectiles for 6 seconds. |
| <Skill id="10197" size="big" disableText/> | Party escort service. |
| <Skill id="10200" size="big" disableText/> | A 1200 range teleport. It breaks <Control name="stun"/> on use, which means it gets executed even if there is no valid path to your mouse target - keep this in mind. |
| <Skill id="29578" size="big" disableText/> | Enables you to use key utilities twice. If you use <Skill id="29830"/> at the end of the cast, you get a "free" mimic and can do stuff like triple <Skill id="10200"/> without the need for any illusions. |
| <Skill id="10267" size="big" disableText/> | Necessary if you need to remove boons and have no <Specialization name="spellbreaker"/>. |
| <Skill id="10245" size="big" disableText/> | Useful for party skipping. Provides 15 seconds of <Effect name="stealth"/> with <Trait id="674"/> and <Skill id="29830"/>. |

Keep in mind that you usually want to replace <Skill id="30814"/> first and use <Skill id="10311"/> instead if you need to swap an utility skill.

As really every skill you have is worth using, you should simply cast everything whenever it is off recharge after following the opener sequence to the left.

If you're running a setup with <Item id="72339"/>, remember to weapon swap as often as possible and use <Skill id="10236"/> and phantasms triggering <Trait id="1866"/> in the 7 seconds afterwards.

### Boons

- <Boon name="quickness"/> with <Skill id="30814"/> and <Trait id="2022"/>
- <Boon name="alacrity"/> with <Skill id="30643"/>, <Skill id="29856"/> and <Trait id="1927"/>
- 15-20x <Boon name="might"/> with <Skill id="49068"/> (<Trait id="1687" disableText/>), <Trait id="1866"/> and <Skill id="10273"/>
- <Boon name="fury"/> with <Skill id="10287"/> (<Trait id="1687" disableText/>) and <Skill id="10273"/>
- <Boon name="protection"/> with <Skill id="30769"/>, <Skill id="10331"/> (<Trait id="669" disableText/>) and <Trait id="667"/>

- <Boon name="resistance"/> with <Skill id="29830"/> (<Trait id="1687" disableText/>)

Are we done yet? No!

### Crowd Control

Break any defiance bar with <Skill id="29519"/>, <Skill id="30643"/> and <Skill id="10287"/>. <Item id="24639"/> on your shield helps as well.

### Conditions

You can put out around 15x <Condition name="vulnerability"/> with <Skill id="10216"/> and your sword auto-attack (the clones from <Skill id="10173"/> and <Skill id="30769"/> execute the sword chain as well!). You can run <Item id="24567"/> instead of <Item id="24615"/> on your staff for additional ~3 stacks.

### DPS

Use <Skill id="10334"/>, your phantasms and <Skill id="21750"/> (optional) whenever they are ready. Don't cancel your sword auto-attacks as the third hit deals the most damage. As soon as you get three illusions up cast <Skill id="49068"/> (plus all other shatters afterwards). You will end up doing around 4-6k DPS on fractal bosses with optimized gear.
