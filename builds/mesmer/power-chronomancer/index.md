The <Specialization text="Power Chronomancer" name="Chronomancer"/> is the strongest (and only) build for <Specialization name="Mesmer"/> in fractals. Despite having one of the highest benchmarks in the game, this build is not that great in fractals due to long rampup times which make it strong for PuGs and a suboptimal pick for faster groups. If necessary the build can bring its own <Boon name="Quickness"/> and <Boon name="Might"/> making it rather self sufficient. 

To succeed as a <Specialization text="Power Chronomancer" name="Chronomancer"/> in higher-end groups you'll need to be able to adapt your rotation on the go and push the limits of your class, but even then you will probably be a hinderance for your group.

This build is profits from sigils like <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/> as well as slaying potions such as <Item name="Powerful Potion of Slaying Scarlets Armies"/>.

Check the [gear optimizer](https://old.discretize.eu) for more gear variants! 

The goal of this build is to reach 100% critical chance when the boss is under the effects of <Condition name="Slow"/> to do this you will require to have either <Skill name="Banner of Discipline"/> or <Trait name="Spotter"/>. If you'd rather not rely on having those you need 200 AR to reach 100% with just <Boon name="Fury"/> and <Trait name="Danger Time"/>, assuming slow.

3. Use <Skill id="10211"/> but always keep one charge except at the end of the fight (if possible during <Skill id="29830"/>)
4. Use <Skill name="Split Second"/> with three clones as much as possible only delay it for <Effect name="Exposed"/>
5. Use <Skill name="Rewinder"/> whenever you don't have any clones, situationally you can shatter it with three clones such as in your burst rotation or when a phase is about to end and <Skill name="Split Second"/> is on cooldown.
    5. <Skill name="Time Sink"/> has higher priority for slow uptime if you have clones to spare mid-phase.
7. Use <Skill id="10334"/> and <Skill id="30525"/>(if used) off recharge


Apart from doing DPS, you have access to a wide range of utilities which can all be used twice with <Skill id="29830"/> if needed. Cast <Skill id="10173"/> to quickly get up another illusion.

<Card title="Information">
Golem rotations out of the raid builds are generally suboptimal in fractals due to <Effect name="Exposed"/> and phases being much shorter compared to raids. The raid rotations are optimized for sustained DPS while in fractals a player needs the ability to adapt a rotation to the amount of time a group needs to finish a phase.  
For that reason you can find a video with openers, that are efficient to use here.
