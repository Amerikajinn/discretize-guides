Due to the continueing nerfs the <Specialization text="Power Staff Weaver" name="weaver"/> it went down in the good builds section for fractals. Still, it offers one of the highest burst and consistent DPS numbers in the game on large, stationary hitboxes. Keep in mind that all six bosses in the current CM fractals are stationary, have a large hitbox and favor burst damage.

Staff Weaver has some utilities in the form of burst <Condition name="vulnerability"/>, AoE <Condition name="blind"/>, <Skill id="5536"/> and easy <Boon name="might"/> pre-stacking. The bad news is that Weaver has no reflects, no fast reachable crowd control skills apart from <Skill id="5733"/> and no <Boon name="stability"/> compared to <Specialization name="Tempest"/>.

The build benefits from slaying potions such as <Item id="50082"/> and <Item name="Impact" type="Sigil"/>.

<Card title="Note about Druid">
The builds are without <Specialization name="Druid"/> since the Glyph of Empowerment skill got removed from the game. <Specialization name="Druid"/> no longer grants damage boost aside from <Skill name="Frost Spirit"/> (<Specialization name="Soulbeast"/> can take that), thus making the Renegade/Firebrand comp even more dominant.

You can still use the [Gear Optimizer](http://old.discretize.eu) if you still play with druid.

<Card title="Skill priority">
The rotation is very complex and highly depends on a good <Boon name="alacrity"/> uptime. Below is a descending list of priorities:

1.  Use <Skill id="5548"/> whenever possible (basically every 6s) and fill the gaps in between with the skills listed below. Any delay on using it will delay your important DPS skills, thus always use <Skill id="5548"/> first.
2.  Use <Skill id="5501"/> whenever possible and immediately switch to <Skill id="5495" disableText/> while casting. Cast <Skill id="5528"/> before switching back to <Skill id="5492" disableText/>, cast <Skill id="43762"/> and finally a new <Skill id="5548"/>.
    1. You can also start in <Skill id="5492" disableText/>/<Skill id="5492" disableText/>, use <Skill id="5548"/>, <Skill id="5679"/>, attune to <Skill id="5495" disableText/>/<Skill id="5492" disableText/> use <Skill id="5528"/> and cast <Skill id="5501"/> while attuning back to <Skill id="5492" disableText/>/<Skill id="5495" disableText/>.
3.  While attuned to <Skill id="5492" disableText/>/<Skill id="5495" disableText/> or <Skill id="5492" disableText/>/<Skill id="5494" disableText/> and <Skill id="5548"/>, <Skill id="41125"/> and <Skill id="43762"/> are on cooldown use a conjured weapon and switch back to <Skill id="5492" disableText/>/<Skill id="5492" disableText/> during the first attack:
    1. In <Skill id="5624"/>: <Skill id="5725"/> (inside the bosses hitbox) => 2x auto-attack chain.
    2. Or in <Skill id="5516"/>: Only when you can whirl against a wall <Skill id="5697"/> => <Skill id="5517"/> => <Skill id="5531"/>. In the standard rotation this weapon is used in <Skill id="5495" disableText/>/<Skill id="5492" disableText/> to skip <Skill id="5519" disableText/>.
    3. Or in <Skill id="5567"/>: <Skill id="5568"/> => <Skill id="5723"/> => <Skill id="5720"/>.
4.  Switch to <Skill id="5494" disableText/> when <Skill id="5737"/> is ready or will be in <4 seconds. Cast <Skill id="41125"/> and <Skill id="5552"/> first and switch back to <Skill id="5492" disableText/>/<Skill id="5494" disableText/> while casting <Skill id="5737"/> to profit from the better modifiers in <Skill id="5492"/>
    1. If <Skill id="5501"/> is ready skip <Skill id="41125"/> and <Skill id="5552"/> and cast <Skill id="5737"/> immediately followed by <Skill id="5501"/> while switching back to <Skill id="5492" disableText/>/<Skill id="5492" disableText/>
    2. You can also use this rotation to cast <Skill id="5737"/>: Start in <Skill id="5492" disableText/>/<Skill id="5492" disableText/>, <Skill id="5548" disableText/>, <Skill id="5679" disableText/>, <Skill id="5495" disableText/>/<Skill id="5492" disableText/>, <Skill id="5528" disableText/>,<Skill id="43762" disableText/> , <Skill id="5501" disableText/>, <Skill id="5494" disableText/>/<Skill id="5495" disableText/>, <Skill id="42321" disableText/>, <Skill id="5737" disableText/>, <Skill id="5492" disableText/>/<Skill id="5494" disableText/>, <Skill id="5548" disableText/>, <Skill id="41125" disableText/> and continue with a weapon.
    3. If you have a source for <Condition name="vulnerability"/> only use <Skill id="5737"/> on bosses where you will only cast one storm per phase, like Skorvald and Ensolyss, or as last storm if the boss is close to death, otherwise cast <Skill id="5736"/>.
5.  Use <Skill id="5539"/> (or <Skill id="5638"/>) three times while double-attuned with <Trait id="2131"/> and holding <Skill id="5624"/> (Ferocity boost), preferably while the defiance bar is broken.
6.  Use <Skill id="5679"/> if you can't finish another <Skill id="5491"/> before leaving <Skill id="5492" disableText/>
7.  Don't start casting <Skill id="5491"/> if you can't finish it
8.  If you are in <Skill id="5492" disableText/>/<Skill id="5492" disableText/> and all relevant skills are on cd attune to <Skill id="5494" disableText/>/<Skill id="5492" disableText/>. Cast <Skill id="5552"/>, <Skill id="41125"/> and one <Skill id="5518"/> while attuning back to <Skill id="5492" disableText/>/<Skill id="5494" disableText/>.
9.  If the boss fight will end in the next seconds and you have no good skills left attune to <Skill id="5494" disableText/>/<Skill id="5492" disableText/> to get a last burst with <Skill id="41125"/> in.
