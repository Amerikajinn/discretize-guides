# Condition Berserker
The <Specialization name="berserker"/> is the superior build choice for all fractal levels.

Besides providing the group with strong damage buffs (<Skill id="14405"/>, <Skill id="14407"/>, <Trait id="1482"/>) as well as mediocre defiance bar damage (<Skill id="30343"/>), the Berserker also deals relatively high personal damage for a support role.

As Berserker your focus is first and foremost providing the group with aforementioned damage buffs, secondly breaking the defiance bar while following your optimized damage rotation.
