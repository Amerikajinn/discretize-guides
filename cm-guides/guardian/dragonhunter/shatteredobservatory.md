### **Precast**
- Precast your Traps (<Skill id="30364"/> and <Skill id="30273"/>) on the boss.
- Use <Skill name="Empower"/> to help with <Boon name="Might"/>. Blast the fire field with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> and <Skill name="Mighty blow"/>.
- Use <Skill name="Feelmywrath"/>.
- Take the mistlock.
- You can precast <Skill id="29789"/> (LB4), <Skill id="9097"/> (Sw2) and <Skill id="9090"/> (Sc2) on the boss.

### **Burn phases**
Your gameplay is heavily influenced by the DPS your team can pull. If your team has very high DPS (i.e. they phase Skorvald in less than 5 seconds) you wanna precast <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> and fire everything you have as soon as you are getting in combat.

### **Adds**
You can kill the first two adds with a greatsword. You can use traps on the 2nd add, without having them on cooldown when you are back at Skorvald. Make sure, that you are on scepter/sword at the last add and you are not having cooldown on the weapon swap, or you DPS will suffer a lot. You can freely use Traps and GS on the first two adds. Swap to scepter/sword after that.

**General**
- If your team does not have a <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/>, you can take <Skill name="Wall of reflection"/> for reflects. Please don't steal the reflect from a <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/>!
- Use <Skill name="shieldofcourage"/> and <Skill name="shieldofwrath"/> strategically to block the <Effect name="Knockback"/> attacks.
- Save a <Skill name="shieldofcourage"/> or <Skill name="shieldofwrath"/> for the expanding AoE so you can deal continues DPS during the mid burn.

### **100%**
- If you are not skipping the first Anomaly, you should place the <Skill name="wallofreflection"/> in the middle.  
- Again it is recommended to start on scepter or sword. 
- Use your <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> to help with CC and boost the party DPS as soon as Artsariiv arrives at the corners.

### *Adds*

### **Synopsis**  
- Play scepter here!
- Good teams: start on scepter/sword, so that you are on scepter during the bloom phase.
- Bad teams: start on greatsword and do SC rotation
- Your goal is to start on scepter/sword at every 10% burn phase, that is why you need to consider weapon swaps carefully. 
- Use <Skill name="binding blade"/> to pull adds. Do not abuse it to farm DPS! Not pulling the adds might kill you during the bloom phase and cost more DPS!
- Cast <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> early, so you get more DPS time. 
- There are two ways to do the blooms fast: 
    1. Walk into the lightning and auto-attack with the scepter. Use <Skill name="Wings of Resolve"/> to jump back to the middle.
    2. Walk into the lightning and auto-attack with the greatsword. After the bloom bounces towards the pillar use <Skill name="Leap of faith"/> on the bloom to finish it. Immediately use <SpecialActionKey name="hypernovalaunch"/> to jump back into the middle.
