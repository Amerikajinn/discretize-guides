### **Precast**
- Use <Skill name="Empower"/> to help with <Boon name="Might"/>. Blast the fire field with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> and <Skill name="Mighty blow"/>.
- Use <Skill name="Feelmywrath"/>.
- You can use <Skill name="hallowed ground"/> for fire field and/or <Skill name="standyourground"/>.
- Take the mistlock.
 
### **Synopsis**
- Start on Scepter/Sword.
- Try to use your full burst (either you start the phase on GS or sword/scepter) in each phase after breakbar is broken.
- Don't forget that you can not expect to see the highest numbers without the breakbar being frequently broken: to make that happen use <Skill name="banesignet"/>. <Specialization name="Renegade"/> and  <Specialization name="Berserker"/> will not break the bar alone without consumables so DO NOT be selfish.
- Do not use traps on the adds.
- Use <Skill name="binding blade"/> inside MAMAs hitbox, when the small adds are coming close.
- Feel free to use <Skill name="symbol of blades"/>, <Skill name="leapoffaith"/> and <Skill name="wingsofresolve"/> for faster movement.
- You can take <Skill name="hammerofwisdom"/> to help CC the adds.

**General guide**
- Use your <Skill name="Binding Blade"/> inside Siax' hitbox to get 5 additional hits. This is the reason why <Specialization name="Guardian"/> is very strong at this boss. Do not miss this.
- Save some <Skill id="9168"/> for a quicker add kill. 
- It is beneficial to take a sword here to quickly blink to the add.
- Use <Skill name="Wings of resolve"/> to navigate around and keep your HP up.
- Use <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> to help with CC and buff your party.
- Use <Skill name="shieldofwrath"/> and <Skill name="Shieldofcourage"/> to block the expanding AoEs.
- Check with your team if you take <Skill name="Feelmywrath"/>

### **Precast**
- Precast your Traps (<Skill id="30364"/> and <Skill id="30273"/>) on the boss and force your team to `/gg`.
- Use <Skill name="Empower"/> to help with <Boon name="Might"/>. Blast the fire field with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> and <Skill name="Mighty blow"/>.
- Take the mistlock.
- You can precast <Skill id="29789"/> (LB4), <Skill id="9097"/> (Sw2) and <Skill id="9090"/> (Sc2) on the boss if you are using a portal.

### **100%-66%**
- Your gameplay is heavily influenced by the DPS your team can pull. 
- If your team has very high DPS (phases Siax in >5s) you wanna precast <Skill name="Bane Signet"/> and fire everything you have as soon as you are getting in combat.   
- No matter what group you are running with, start on scepter/sword! 
- If you are running in a PuG or just clear it daily, it is beneficial to delay your traps slightly, to fit more of the hits into the cc bar. 
- In a fast team save <Skill name="bindingblade"/> for the 2nd phase when the adds spawn, if not use it. Just make sure to press it when the adds are in range for big DPS.

### *1st Add*
- Use <Skill name="spearofjustice"/> on your add for the modifier from <Trait name="biggamehunter"/>. 
- <Skill name="Whirling wrath"/> and a couple AA to kill it.
- Use <Skill name="wingsofresolve"/>, <Skill name="Symbol of blades"/> and <Skill name="Leapoffaith"/> for movement.

### **66%-33%**
Nothing extraordinary, all information from 100-66 and tl;dr are still valid. Try to end on scepter/sword.

### *2nd Add*
- Use <Skill name="spearofjustice"/> on your add for the modifier from <Trait name="biggamehunter"/>. 
- Kill it with a symbol and AAs.
- In fast runs you might wanna save a <Skill name="Swordofjustice"/>.

### **33%-0%**
Nothing extraordinary, all information from 100-66 and tl;dr are still valid. Try to end on scepter/sword.

### **Precast**
- Use <Skill name="Empower"/> to help with <Boon name="Might"/>. Blast the fire field with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> and <Skill name="Mighty blow"/>.
- Use <Skill name="Feelmywrath"/>.
- You can use <Skill name="hallowed ground"/> for fire field and/or <Skill name="standyourground"/>.

### **Synopsis**
- Breakbar should be broken at the start of the fight, use <Skill name="banesignet"/> to help to make it happen.
- Start on Scepter/Sword.
- Try to fit every single skill you have into <Effect name="Exposed"> (few seconds after the bar is broken), feel free to precast a symbol, and <Skill name="Swordofjustice"/> before Ensolyss becomes vulnerable.
- After you used your full opener, continue with your usual rotation until you phase.
- Repeat this every single phase.
