- This rotation assumes the <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> will use <Skill name="potent haste"/>,  <Skill name="restoringreprieve"/> and <Skill name="feelmywrath"/> when in range of all 5 allies in order to keep up <Boon name="quickness"/> and <Boon name="fury"/>! 
- <Skill name="banesignet"/> is timed for DPS phases (in order to meet DPS checks). It is usually timed for Breakbars with the signets active effect being up during <Effect name="exposed"/>  as suggested in the rotation **below**.
- This comp resides in the "PuG meta" category and as a result will include some requirements atypical of the meta. Including <Skill name="Mantraofliberation"/> which as a result might affect <Boon name="fury"/> uptime. One must consider all uptimes, including <Boon name="fury"/> when playing in any group especially a PuG. 
- When constructing the guide for <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> we concluded that the single easiest way to carry as a <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> on _MAMA_ is to provide reliable CC for the adds and boss alike!
- In a PuG scenario it makes sense to include <Skill name="hammer of wisdom"/>.
</Boss>

<Message>
In any significant downtime in your rotation during this run, Use <Skill name="tome of justice"/> Chapter 4 and blast it with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/> this will help upkeep <Boon name="might"/>. Every time a _Knight_ dies it resets your <Skill name="tome of justice"/>.
</Message>

### **Prestacking**

1) <Skill name="Empower"/> 
2) Use 2 charges of <Skill name="potent haste"/> and share <Skill name="restoringreprieve"/> (keep in mind that <Skill name="restoringreprieve"/> only shares <Boon name="quickness"/> once every 7 second thanks to <Trait name=" liberators vow"/>)
4)  <Skill name="Feelmywrath"/> 
5)  <Skill name="banesignet"/>
6) Take _Mistlock Singularity_
7)  <Skill name="Feelmywrath"/> (exclude this usage if running <Skill name="Mantra of liberation"/>)
8) <Skill name="Empower"/> 

### **1st Phase**

2)  <Skill name="banesignet"/> to CC
3)  <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/> For <Boon name="fury"/>
4)  <Skill name="Blazing Edge"/> to finish CC

7)  (If the DPS is high **DO NOT BREAK** defiance bar before 50%)
8) Cast <Skill name="Tome of courage"/> Chapter 5,4,3 while moving toward the second add. This is for two major reasons: Firstly chapter 3 reflects the projectiles (or red AoEs on the ground which do lethal damage) and lastly provides <Boon name="protection"/> and <Boon name="resistance"/> when allies are animation locked while CCing the second _Knight_.

### _2nd Add_

1) Use <Skill name="hammerofwisdom"/>

### _3rd Add_

1) Use <Skill name="hammerofwisdom"/>
3) (Use a single cast of <Skill name="Mantra of liberation"/> if instant CC failed, before the _Knight_ lands his jump! Provided the final charge remains!) <Label>Situational</Label>

### **4th Phase**

1) Help CC with whatever you have.
2)  <Skill name="shieldofjudgment"/> to provide <Boon name="Aegis"/> for _MAMA_'s lethal jump attack. Use the final charge of <Skill name="restoringreprieve"/> to ensure allies do not take damage!
3) Having saved the last charge on  <Skill name="Mantra of liberation"/> , use it right before _MAMA_ lands her jump!
6)  <Skill name="Blazing Edge"/>

9)  <Skill name="Empower"/> to max out <Boon name="might"/>

- This rotation assumes the <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> will use <Skill name="potent haste"/>,  <Skill name="restoringreprieve"/> and <Skill name="feelmywrath"/> when in range of all 5 allies in order to keep up <Boon name="quickness"/> and <Boon name="fury"/>! 
- <Skill name="banesignet"/> is timed for DPS phases (in order to meet DPS checks). It is usually timed for Breakbars with the signets active effect being up during <Effect name="exposed"/>  as suggested in the rotation **below**.
- Use well timed <Skill name="restoringreprieve"/> to give <Boon name="aegis"/>.
- <Skill name="tome of resolve"/> Chapter 5,4,1 situationally in order to heal up your allies! Remember Chapter 5 is a healing effectiveness modifier improving outgoing healing by 33%.
- Siax is a boss that benefits greatly from all party members stacking tightly for heals and meeting the minimum DPS checks.
- Siax is also a fight which does not rely heavily on CC.
- As a result, it is paramount as a <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> that you are able to time <Boon name="aegis"/> and <Boon name="stability"/>, while topping up healing situationally. Take <Skill name="retreat"/> if you are struggling with consistency!
- When the group is dealing with the <Instability name="We Bleed Fire"/> , <Boon name="aegis"/> can be stripped by this attack **right before** the hallucination AoE fully expands. It is therefore really helpful to take <Skill name="retreat"/> as a backup!
- See Phase 2 'step 8' where it states one should use <Skill name="tomeofresolve"/> for Scholar uptime. This is only true for groups **with higher group DPS who meet the DPS checks** and the situational timing of the tome can save the group! Try not to use the tome for the benefit of 1 player only during a split.
</Boss>


### **Prestacking**

1)  <Skill name="Empower"/> 
2) Use 2 charges of <Skill name="potent haste"/> and share <Skill name="restoringreprieve"/> (keep in mind that <Skill name="restoringreprieve"/> only shares <Boon name="quickness"/> once every 7 second thanks to <Trait name=" liberators vow"/>)
4) <Skill name="Feelmywrath"/> 
5)  <Skill name="banesignet"/>
6) Take _Mistlock Singularity_
7)  <Skill name="Feelmywrath"/> 
8)  <Skill name="Empower"/> 

### **1st Phase**

1)  <Skill name="tome of justice"/>, use Chapter 4 Scorched Aftermath
2)  <Skill name="holystrike"/> to blast <Skill name="tome of justice"/>'s Scorched Aftermath
3) Weapon Swap
3)  <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/> For <Boon name="fury"/>
4) <Skill name="Blazing Edge"/>
5)  <Skill name="banesignet"/> to CC (if your groups DPS is high enough it will be up during split)
5)  <Skill name="Shield of absorption"/>
7) If DPS is low be ready to use <Skill name="Retreat"/> to <Boon name="aegis"/> the Hallucination's AoE (Vital Importance)


### *Split Phase 1*

1) Position yourself with the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> using axe to aid DPS on add!
2)  <Skill name="tomeofresolve"/> Ready if a DPS desperatly needs healing. <Label>Situational</Label>
3) While Moving back to _Siax_ use <Skill name="tomeofresolve"/> 5 and 4 and spam 1 to heal players up. <Label>Situational and only if high DPS</Label>

### **2nd Phase**

1) While <Effect name="exposed"/> is still on the boss Weapon Swap
2)  <Skill name="Empower"/>
3)  <Skill name="Retreat"/> To <Boon name="aegis"/> the _Hallucination_'s AoE (Vital Importance)
7) Cast <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> 4 and 5 then use up all charges with skill 1 (This, if timed correctly, will do three things. Namely: it will <Boon name="aegis"/> the _Hallucination_'s AoE, put <Boon name="stability"/> for the "swipe" attack and ensure the group has <Boon name="protection"/> for when the _Volatile hallucinations_ pop)
8) Cast <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> and attempt to <Control name="pull"/> the _Volatile Hallucinations_ using Chapter 3 so not all of them blow up in middle at once. (This is the moment where groups with low DPS will likely wipe and therefore a situational moment where having saved your <Skill name="tome of resolve"/> might save the group!) <Label>Situational</Label>
9) Use Chapter 4 Scorched aftermath
10) Blast With <Skill name="holystrike"/>
11) Weapon Swap

### *Split Phase 2*

1) Position yourself with the <Specialization name="Renegade"/> using axe to aid DPS on add!
2)  <Skill name="tomeofresolve"/> Ready if a DPS desperatly needs healing. <Label>Situational</Label>
3) While moving back to _Siax_ use <Skill name="tomeofresolve"/> 5 and 4 and spam 1 to heal players up. <Label>Situational and only if high DPS</Label>

### **3rd Phase**

1)  <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/> For <Boon name="fury"/>
2)  <Skill name="Blazing Edge"/>
3)  <Skill name="banesignet"/> to CC
6)  Weapon Swap 
7)   <Skill name="Empower"/> while <Effect name="exposed"/> (Ideally you will be quick enough in every scenario above to be precasting Empower before the breakbar is finished)
8) Use <Skill name="Retreat"/> to <Boon name="aegis"/> the Hallucination's AoE (Vital Importance)
9) If <Skill name="tome of resolve"/> was used at the start of Phase 2, where group DPS is higher, it may be off cooldown. Simply use Chapter 5,4 and spam 1 to ensure players are max health <Label>Situational</Label>

- This rotation assumes the <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> will use <Skill name="potent haste"/>,  <Skill name="restoringreprieve"/> and <Skill name="feelmywrath"/> when in range of all 5 allies in order to keep up <Boon name="quickness"/> and <Boon name="fury"/>! 
- <Skill name="banesignet"/> is timed for DPS phases (in order to meet DPS checks). It is usually timed for Breakbars with the signets active effect being up during <Effect name="exposed"/>  as suggested in the rotation **below**.
- Use well timed <Skill name="restoringreprieve"/> to give <Boon name="aegis"/>.
- <Skill name="tome of resolve"/> Chapter 5,4,1 are used situationally in order to heal up your allies! Remember Chapter 2 is also a condition cleanse (as well as chapter 5) and will help mitigating _Ensolys_' auto attack.
- <Skill name="Sanctuary"/> is a really underrated CC skill which fits perfectly for Ensolyss as <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/>. Due to it's cooldown it has less use elsewhere in fractals, but is available for every phase on Ensolyss. Sanctuary has a base CC of 750 (and can be traited in virtues to 1050 defiance **only** if the group needs more CC) and has the added benefit of being a CC over time.
-  <Skill name="Empower"/> is timed during <Effect name="exposed"/> and <Control name="stun"/> for two reasons: Firstly it's a well timed heal for <Boon name="Might"/> and lastly, due to it's cast time it can be tricky to use during Ensolyss' many attacks.

- This rotation assumes the <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> will use <Skill name="potent haste"/>,  <Skill name="restoringreprieve"/> and <Skill name="feelmywrath"/> when in range of all 5 allies in order to keep up <Boon name="quickness"/> and <Boon name="fury"/>! 
- <Skill name="banesignet"/> is timed for DPS phases (in order to meet DPS checks). It is usually timed for Breakbars with the signets active effect being up during <Effect name="exposed"/>  as suggested in the rotation **below**.
- Use <Skill name="restoringreprieve"/> to give <Boon name="aegis"/>.
- <Skill name="tome of resolve"/> Chapter 5,4,1 Situationally in order to heal up your allies! Remember chapter 2 is also a condition cleanse (as well as chapter 5) and will help to cleanse players <Condition name="Burning"/>.
- This encounter is fairly straight forward for a <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/>, their role is to ensure any and all breakbars are broken as soon as possible and that <Boon name="stability"/> and <Skill name="banesignet"/> are timed correctly.
- If your group DPS is low ensure to save your <Skill name="tome of courage"/> (and if REALLY low your <Skill name="Stand your ground"/> too) for the final phase, this is due to Skorvalds melee attack which will chain <Control name="knockdown"/> as well as deal a large amount of damage AND <Effect name="agony"/>.
- One aspect worth noting is island 4 on each split phase. Uses <Skill name="Stand your ground"/> to give <Boon name="Stability"/> to players (as well as not to be interrupted), <Skill name="empower"/> to ensure players are at 25 <Boon name="Might"/> before the DPS phase and <Skill name="bane signet"/> to increase all party member's power by 216.
- Make sure to use CC skills where needed. If the breakbar has regenerated in time for phase 3. Be ready to break it as quickly as possible before _Skorvald_'s <Control name="Stun"/> finishes.
</Boss>

 Notes:
 1) If your <Specialization name="Renegade"/> runs <Skill name="Legendary Dwarf Stance"/> then you are able to co-ordinate <Boon name="stability"/> with them! Remember in a PuG scenario having too much <Boon name="stability"/> is better than not enough!
 2) Be careful with what island you choose for your <Item name="white mantle portal device"/>: Don't use it at the island where you are supposed to enter any of your tomes

- This rotation assumes the <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> will use <Skill name="potent haste"/>,  <Skill name="restoringreprieve"/> and <Skill name="feelmywrath"/> when in range of all 5 allies in order to keep up <Boon name="quickness"/> and <Boon name="fury"/>! 
- <Skill name="banesignet"/> is timed for DPS phases (in order to meet DPS checks). It is usually timed for Breakbars with the signets active effect being up during <Effect name="exposed"/>  as suggested in the rotation **below**.
- Use <Skill name="restoringreprieve"/> to give <Boon name="aegis"/>.
- <Skill name="tome of resolve"/> Chapter 5,4,1 Situationally in order to heal up your allies!
- Remember chapter 5 is a healing effectiveness modifier improving outgoing healing by 33%.
- Your predominant role as a <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> in this fight is to provide sufficient <Boon name="aegis"/> and <Boon name="stability"/> for various attacks. This is essential in order to ensure your DPS players are able to reflect without being interupted!
- The reflect on _Artsariiv_ scales power from it's origin in question (the boss). So with that in mind <Skill name="banesignet"/>'s active 216 power' would only benefit the groups DPS during <Effect name="exposed"/> This does not mean "do not take signet". It means that it should be used for the benefit of the group's DPS (with or without a breakbar!). With that said, the reflected projectiles themselves scale with the **player's precision**! If you are a <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> on _Artsariiv_ **do not reflect or destroy projectiles**!
- In more experienced groups, the anomaly will be skipped entirely. Where the breakbar is expected to be broken instantly the projectiles are reflected back **during** <Effect name="exposed"/>. It can be quite tricky as a group to accomplish this is due to the need for fast group CC. It is however easy to practice, as in order to time it correctly you simply CC the boss as soon as it's breakbar appears in Phase 1.
- Use <Skill name="Mantraofliberation"/> if you miss time an <Boon name="aegis"/>, using a single charge as a backup is a nice fallback. Provided it does not mess with 'step 2' on each phase.
 - Try to time <Skill name="standyourground"/>  and <Skill name="banesignet"/> together to ensure +216 power for the DPS players during burn phases as well as <Boon name="stability"/> during phases 2 and 3.

- This rotation assumes the <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Heal Firebrand"/> will use <Skill name="potent haste"/>,  <Skill name="restoringreprieve"/> and <Skill name="feelmywrath"/> when in range of all 5 allies in order to keep up <Boon name="quickness"/> and <Boon name="fury"/>! 
- <Skill name="banesignet"/> is timed for DPS phases (in order to meet DPS checks). It is usually timed for Breakbars with the signets active effect being up during <Effect name="exposed"/>  as suggested in the rotation **below**.
- Use <Skill name="restoringreprieve"/> to give <Boon name="aegis"/>.
- <Skill name="tome of resolve"/> Chapter 5,4,1 to heal up the party! Remember Chapter 5 is a healing effectiveness modifier improving outgoing healing by 33%.
- Remember to precast <Skill name="standyourground"/> on _Mistlock Singularity_ before entering _Arkk_ to prevent players from <Condition name="Fear"/>.
- This rotation helps with <Boon name="Might"/> uptime through the abuse of the trait <Trait name"renewedjustice"'> where <Skill name="tomeofjustice"/> is reset after killing an add. It is important to use <Skill name="tomeofjustice"/> **before** or during every add phase, before the add dies! Be on staff (and ready with <SpecialActionKey name="hypernovalaunch"/> ) in order to blast!
- All three skills <Skill name="restoringreprieve"/>,<Skill name="standyourground"/> and <Skill name="tomeofresolve"/> are used situationally: to <Boon name="aegis"/> melee attacks, provide <Boon name="stability"/> for the <Condition name="Fear"/> and do <Control name="knockdown"/> to provide burst heals.
