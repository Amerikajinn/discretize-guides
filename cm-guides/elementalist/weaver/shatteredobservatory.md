<Message>
One of the most important things in this fight is to keep up <Boon name="Might"/> and boons at the four _Elite Flux Anomalies_. To achieve this you need to be fast enough with your damage, hit your blasts correctly and not get hit by the shockwaves and knockbacks.

<Message>
Advanced groups can let the second _Corporeal Reassignment_ trigger and `/gg` the third to save time. But if you failed the first nuke always make sure to kill the second _Temporal Anomaly_. Also sometimes there are communication issues, so if you have the third _Corporeal Reassignment_ always check if someone killed the _Temporal Anomaly_, before killing yourself.
