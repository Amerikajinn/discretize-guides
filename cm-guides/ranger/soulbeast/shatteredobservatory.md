You can swap <Item id="24868"/> for <Item id="24661"/> in your longbow if you want.

<Message>
Spirit Management:
- This depends on how your <Specialization name ="Renegade"/> plays, if they precast <Skill id="45686"/> before Skorvald spawns then you can summon your <Skill name="Frostspirit"/> down on the boss platform after the precast and the Kalla heal skill will sustain it until the second phase. In this scenario you don't teleport it at all you just leave it behind.
- If they don't do this then you will want to summon the spirit next to the Boss Challenge Mote and let it tick down in health for a couple of ticks and then pull it firstly down to Skorvald after the precast and then to the first island using <Skill name="Cold Snap"/> in order to kill it so it is back up for island 4 to be resummoned. This is the method described in the guide below.
</Message>

**Precast**
- When you are activating the Boss Challenge Mote run down to the boss platform and precast <Skill name="Frosttrap"/> on the boss like a <Specialization name="Dragonhunter"/> in disguise. Then /gg and wait up by the Mote until you are ready to precast.
- When you are ready to precast summon your <Skill name="Frostspirit"/> next to the Mote then run down and begin precasting with your party. Remember to share <Skill name="Moastance"/> and blast <Boon name="Might"/> with <Skill name="Callofthewild"/>.
- Pick up the <Skill id="5516"/> from your <Specialization name="Weaver"/>, then share <Skill name="One wolf pack"/> and finally take the mistlock.
- Use <Skill id="5697"/> (Fiery Greatsword skill 3) to get down to the platform, teleport your <Skill name="Frostspirit"/> down to the platform then precast <Skill id="5531"/>, <Skill name="Barrage"/> and swap to sword/axe.

**Opening**

- When your first <Skill name="Frosttrap"/> procs cast it again and use <Skill name="Onewolfpack"/>.
- <Skill name="pathofscars"/> then when Skorvald is targetable, use <Skill name="Sicem"/> and <Skill id="45743"/> (to CC).
- <Skill name="Whirlingdefense"/> into <Effect name="Exposed"/>.
- Use <Skill name="Hornet Sting"/> to get to the first island once it is phased.

**Islands**  
- Call <Skill name="Frostspirit"/> to the 1st island using <Skill name="Cold Snap"/> and use <Skill name="Worldlyimpact"/> and autoattacks to kill the add.
- You can use <Skill name="whirlingdefense"/> on the 2nd one after it jumps.
- Swap to longbow and kill the 3rd add with <Skill name="Point Blank Shot"/> and <Skill name="Rapid Fire"/>.
- Resummon <Skill name="Frostspirit"/> on the last island. Take the portal early to teleport <Skill name="Frostspirit"/> using <Skill name="Cold Snap"/> to you and to precast <Skill name="Barrage"/> before Skorvald becomes vulnerable.

**66% and 33%**

- <Skill name="Frosttrap"/>, <Skill name="Sicem"/>.
- **Don't use <Skill name="Onewolfpack"/> in phase 2 unless you don't think you'll make the dps check.**
- Do use <Skill name="Onewolfpack"/> in phase 3.
- <Skill name="pathofscars"/> -> <Skill name="Whirlingdefense"/>.

**Additional Note**
- Warhorn can be a replacement for Longbow here, <Skill name="Callofthewild"/> is a blast finisher allowing you to stack <Boon name="Might"/> on the islands. You simply use <Skill id="12620"/> before you start attacking in each phase.

  - Pulling the adds is also great since they can hurt your teams <Item id="24836"/> uptime.
