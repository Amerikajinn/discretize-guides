- If you don't trust your group to deal DPS in phase 2 then you can take <Trait id="2128"/> and use <Skill name="OneWolfPack"/> when you return to MAMA in phase 2. The reason for this is because in phase 1, 3 and 4 you have the damage modifier from <Effect name="Exposed"/> since MAMAs breakbar is broken in these phases but in phase 2 you don't have as many damage modifiers so <Skill name="OneWolfPack"/> can help the team phase MAMA faster here.
- In faster kills you want to run <Item id="82876"/> instead of <Item id="24615"/> on longbow.
- Pet: <Skill id="43636" disableText/> Rock Gazelle.
- Take <Trait id="2143"/>.

<Message>
This fight gets very messy if the adds are not immediately CCed. Especially at this fight it is recommended to grab [consumables](/guides/consumables) to make up for the lack of CC of your team mates.

### **Precast**

- Precast <Skill name="Frosttrap"/> on the boss orb like a <Specialization name="Dragonhunter"/> in disguise.
- Remember to share <Skill name="Moastance"/> and blast <Boon name="Might"/> with <Skill name="Callofthewild"/>.

- Summon <Skill name="Frostspirit"/> when you go through the portal.
- Precast <Skill id="5531"/> and then <Skill name="Barrage"/>.
- <Skill name="Frosttrap"/> as soon as your first trap procs so you have both ticking at the same time.

- <Skill name="Rapidfire"/> and <Skill id="41524"/> before the breakbar.
- <Skill id="45743"/> followed by <Skill name="Pointblankshot"/> to CC.
- When the bar breaks use <Skill name="Worldlyimpact"/> then swap weapons and <Skill name="Path of scars"/> to land both attacks into <Effect name="Exposed"/>.

### _1st Add_

### **2nd Phase**

- Use <Skill name="Hornet Sting"/> to get back to Siax. 
- Use <Skill name="onewolfpack"/> in the middle to share it to your allies.
- Autoattack and use <Skill name="Path of scars"/>, <Skill id="45743"/> and <Skill id="41524"/>.
- Swap to longbow at around 40% so weapon swap is back off cd for phase 3.

### _2nd Add_

- You want to stand at range to benefit from <Trait name="Farsighted"/> as well as you might want to use <Skill name="wehealasone"/> to make sure you have <Trait id="974"/> and <Item id="24836"/> as damage modifiers to kill the add.
- Use longbow skills to kill your add: <Skill name="pointblankshot"/> and <Skill name="rapidfire"/>.
- The remaining damage should be dealt by the <Specialization name="Dragonhunter"/> with a <Skill name="Swordofjustice"/>.
- Once the add is dead precast <Skill name="Barrage"/> on Siax for phase 3.

### **3rd Phase**

- <Skill name="sicem"/> and <Skill name="Frost trap"/> once Siax is vulnerable.
- Swap weapons.
- Use <Skill name="Worldly impact"/> to make sure you have quickness, <Skill name="Path of scars"/> -> <Skill name="Whirling defense"/>.
