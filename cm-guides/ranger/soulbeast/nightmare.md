- It makes sense to use [consumables](/guides/consumables) on the adds!
</Boss>

<Message>
This fight gets very messy if the adds are not immediately CCed. Especially at this fight it is recommended to grab [consumables](/guides/consumables) to make up for the lack of CC of your team mates.

- If you don't trust your group to deal DPS in phase 2 then you can take <Trait id="2128"/> and use <Skill name="OneWolfPack"/> when you return to MAMA in phase 2. The reason for this is because in phase 1, 3 and 4 you have the damage modifier from <Effect name="Exposed"/>, so compensating with <Skill name="OneWolfPack"/> can help the team phase MAMA faster here.
- In faster kills you want to run <Item id="82876"/> instead of <Item id="24615"/> on longbow.
- Pet: <Skill id="43636" disableText/> Rock Gazelle.
- Take <Trait id="2143"/>.

- Swap weapons.
- <Skill name="Point Blank Shot"/> to proc <Item id="84505"/>.
- <Skill name="Rapid Fire"/>.

### _2nd Add_

- Help CCing with <Skill id="45743"/>.
- Precast <Skill name="Barrage"/> to hit MAMA and the add.
- Use a mix of <Skill name="Rapid Fire"/> and autoattacks to kill the add.

### **3rd Phase**

- <Skill name="Sicem"/>.
- <Skill name="Point Blank Shot"/> to CC and proc <Item id="84505"/>.
- Swap weapons.
- <Skill name="Path of scars"/> -> <Skill name="Whirling defense"/>.

### _3rd Add_

- Resummon your <Skill id="12497"/> as it has probably died by now.
- Swap weapons as soon as it is off cd (<Skill name="Path of scars"/> if you can before swapping). 
- Autoattack as well as using <Skill name="Worldly impact"/> and <Skill id="41524"/>.

### **4th Phase**

- Try to cast <Skill name="Barrage"/> so it doesn't get interrupted by MAMA jumping.
- Use <Skill name="Point Blank Shot"/> and <Skill id="45743"/> to CC and proc <Item id="84505"/>.

- Summon <Skill name="Frostspirit"/> when you go through the portal.

### _2nd Add_
