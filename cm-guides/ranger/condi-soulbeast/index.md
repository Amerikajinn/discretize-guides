### **Precast**
<Message>
Boons get removed upon entering combat here, so stacking them is pointless. Effects will stay though so take advantage of that and precast what you can.
</Message>

- Merge with Bristleback and cast <Skill name="sharpen spines"/>, and then swap back to Lynx.
- Cast <Skill name="Vulture stance"/>, <Skill name="sharpening stone"/>, <Skill name="one wolf pack"/> and <Skill name="moa stance"/>
- Take mistlock _Mistlock Singularity_ and swap any skills back you have changed.
- As you walk into the arena make sure to stack <Trait id="1912"/> for some extra initial damage.
- Cast <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> so it spawns towards the middle of the arena.

### **Light Ai, Keeper of the Peak**
<Message>
In pug groups it is reccomended to cc Ai in the middle of the arena. This will give you  the maximum amount of time to DPS Ai, which will allow most groups to skip most of the split phases. On SLB you dont want to delay your <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/> as it will stop you from swapping to Dagger/Torch and dealing  as much damage, but you shold delay your <Skill id="46432"/> if you need to. Ideally Ai's CC bar should break as the Red Agony field spawns beneath her.
</Message>
### _Air Phase_
- As you get into combat cast <Skill name="Vulture Stance"/> and <Skill name="Sharpening Stone"/>. Use <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/>, <Skill name="Crippling Shot"/>, <Skill name="Poison Volley"/> and follow Ai to the side.
- As you reach the side call <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> to you with <Skill name="Solar Flare"/>.
- Cast <Skill name="one wolf pack"/> and swap to Dagger/Torch and use <Skill name="Bonfire"/>, <Skill name="Double Arc"/>, <Skill name="Throw Torch"/> and your <Skill id="42944"/> skills.
- Remember to dodge as often as you can to keep <Trait name="Light on your Feet"/> active and use <Skill name="Double Arc"/> and <Skill name="Throw Torch"/> as they come off cooldown.
- Swap back to Shortbow and follow Ai to the middle of the arena and as the expanding AoE's appear use <Skill name="Quick Shot"/> to dodge back so you dont get unmerged,
- After the split mechanic call <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> mid with <Skill name ="Solar Flare"/>. As the CC bar comes up use <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/> and <Skill id="46432"/>, then swap to Dagger/Torch continueing with your rotation until Ai phases (Hopefully before the air split phase happens).


### _Fire Phase_
<Message>
Ideally your group will use a xera portal to get back to the middle to DPS Ai quickly. Make sure you communicate with your team before the fight to work out if you or someone else will drop one.
</Message>
- As the split phase ends take a Xera portal back to the middle casting <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> as you go through.
- Once in the middle use <Skill name="One Wolf Pack"/>, <Skill name="Vulture Stance"/> and <Skill name="Sharpening Stone"/>.
- Use <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/>, <Skill name="Crippling Shot"/> and <Skill name="Poison Volley"/> then swap to Dagger/Torch.
- Swap to Dagger/Torch and use <Skill name="Bonfire"/>, <Skill name="Double Arc"/>, <Skill name="Throw Torch"/> and your <Skill id="42944"/> skills
Keep DPSing until you need to head to the safe spot by the Meteor. Once it is safe to leave use <Skill name="Instinctive Engage"/> to reach Ai quickly so you can use <Skill name="Double Arc"/> and <Skill name="Throw Torch"/> before Ai dashes away from mid.
- Swap to Shortbow and follow, calling <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> to you with <Skill name="Solar Flare"/> once you reach the side and camp Shortbow until Ai dashes back to the middle.
- Follow Ai to the middle of the arena and as the expanding AoE's appear use <Skill name="Quick Shot"/> to dodge back so you dont get unmerged,
- After the split mechanic call <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> mid with <Skill name ="Solar Flare"/>. As the CC bar comes up use <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/> and <Skill id="46432"/>, then swap to Dagger/Torch continueing with your rotation until Ai phases (Hopefully before the meteors fall).

### _Water Phase_
<Message>
There is not much you can do in the split phase here, so just make sure to keep an eye on tethers and to give/take them if you or someone else is close to 9 stacks. If your <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> has died remember to summon it towards the end of the split phase. It is also beneficial to be in the center of the arena her so you have less distance to walk when Ai dhashes to the side again.
</Message>
- Summon <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> if it has died shortly before ai becomes vunerable,
- Once vunerable cast <Skill name="Vulture Stance"/> and <Skill name="Sharpening Stone"/>. Use <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/>, <Skill name="Crippling Shot"/>, <Skill name="Poison Volley"/> and follow Ai to the side.
- As you reach the side call <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> to you with <Skill name="Solar Flare"/>.
- Cast <Skill name="one wolf pack"/> and swap to Dagger/Torch and use <Skill name="Bonfire"/>, <Skill name="Double Arc"/>, <Skill name="Throw Torch"/> and your <Skill id="42944"/> skills.
- Remember to dodge as often as you can to keep <Trait name="Light on your Feet"/> active and use <Skill name="Double Arc"/> and <Skill name="Throw Torch"/> as they come off cooldown.
- Swap back to Shortbow and follow Ai to the middle of the arena. 
- As the expanding AoE's appear use <Skill name="Quick Shot"/> to dodge back so you dont get unmerged, and after the split mechanic call <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> mid with <Skill name ="Solar Flare"/>.
- As the CC bar comes up use <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/> and <Skill id="46432"/>, then swap to Dagger/Torch continueing with your rotation until Ai phases (Hopefully before the water split phase happens).
- If the water split happens ther is not much you can do since Ai will reflect all projectiles, so help your team by standing in the greens and taking tethers. Once the split phase finishes Ai should be on low health, so follow her if she dhashes and continue with your rotation until she phases.

<Message>
The following guide assumes your group will instantly cc Ai; and will phase at the side or shortly after on the light phases, and on the dark phase after 66% will stay in the middle untill close to the end of the fight. If this doesn't happen be prepared to adjust your rotation accordingly. It also assumes you are running <Trait name="Quickdraw"/>, if you are not running this you will not get a second<Skill name="Bonfire"/> in your Dagger/Torch rotation and will need to again adjust your rotation.

### _Fire Phase_

<Message>
In pug groups it is reccomended to cc Ai after she dashes from the side on the 100%-66% phase. This will give you the maximum amount of time to DPS Ai to 66% stopping some mechanics from overlapping as you go to CC the first Sorrow. On SLB you dont want to delay your <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/> as it will stop you from swapping to Dagger/Torch and dealing as much damage, but you shold delay your <Skill id="46432"/> if you need to. Ideally Ai's CC bar should break as the Red Agony field spawns beneath her. After 66% you should CC Ai if you can, but it is more important to make sure you have enough CC to break the Sorrows so you don't wipe.

### _66% - 33%_
<Message>
Your rotation from here will depend on your groups DPS and Ai's RNG. In general remember to dodge as much as you can to keep <Trait name="Light on your Feet"/> active and use your mobility skills to keep attacking Ai as much as you can. <Skill name="Sun Spirit"/> will probably die a couple of times so make sure you resummon it as soon as you can, and call it to you when you move. Finally CC Ai when you can, but also remember to use <Skill name="Concussion Shot"/> and <Skill id="46432"/> to keep up <Trait name="Twice as Vicious"/>.
