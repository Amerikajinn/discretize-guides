### **100%-66%**

- <Skill name="Tremor"/> and <Skill name="Pommelbash"/>, <Skill name="Headbutt"/>.

  - <Skill name="cycloneaxe"/>, <Skill name="dualstrike"/>.
  - <Skill name="decapitate"/>.
- If your party is not the fastest pick up your banners and redrop them on the main island. Put them slightly outside of the stack so you don't take a portal on accident.

### _Islands_

- Swap to your warhorn or torch if you have it and use the blasts in fire fields for <Boon name="Might"/> at 2nd and 4th island.
- Don't use heavy cooldowns after the 3rd island.
- On the last island shortly before the add dies use <Skill name="Mending"/> and open <Skill name="Berserk"/> already.

### **66%-33%**

- Follow the standard fractal rotation.
- If your party does not phase Skorvald without a dash, recast your banners.
- Before you move to the 1st island pick your banners up and drop them on the main island. Put them slightly outside of the stack so you don't take a portal on accident.

The rest of the fight follows accordingly.
