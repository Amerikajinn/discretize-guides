- Take <Trait id="1977"/>!
- It makes sense to use [consumables](/guides/consumables) on the adds!
</Boss>

<Message>
This fight gets very messy if the adds are not immediately CCed. Especially at this fight it is recommended to grab [consumables](/guides/consumables) to make up for the lack of CC of your team mates. 
</Message>
This guide is a PuG friendly version without banner precast. Please remember that CCing all bars fast is the most important bit in this fight. You won't get a good kill - might even wipe your party - if you greed DPS without CC. 

There is an invisible hitbox in the center of the arena allowing you to gain enough adrenaline for one <Skill name="decapitate"/> with only two critical hits!

- Precast <Skill name="Tremor"/> for CC.
- Use <Skill name="headbutt"/> to CC quickly.
