These rotations are **not** set in stone and therefore you should adjust your gameplay with how your party plays. Pay attention to the length of the phases, any upcoming CC that might be needed, and also pay attention to your energy and the management thereof.

**Legends**  

<Skill name="Legendary Renegade stance"/> and <Skill name="Legendary Centaur Stance"/>.

---

**Precast**
* Wait for your teammates to drop a fire field and in case you have a <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/>, wait until they use <Skill name="Moa Stance"/> which increases your boon duration by 20 %.
* Your pre stacking is relatively simple and follows the same pattern on every boss. Cast <Skill name="Orders from Above"/> and <Skill name="Renewing Wave"/> and take the mistlock and cast them again.

**100 - 75%**  

* Cast <Skill name="DarkrazorsDaring"/> on MAMA as soon as the red circle appears.
* Cast <Skill name="IcerazorsIre"/> right before MAMA becomes vulnerable.
* Use <Skill name="Surgeofthemists"/> to break the defiance bar. Be aware of your positioning to gain an additional hit.
* Swap your weapons as soon as you are no longer in MAMA's hitbox where your <Skill name="Surge of the mists"/> could hit so you stop casting that skill to save some time.
* Swap your legend to <Skill name="Legendary Centaur Stance"/> and cast <Skill name="Citadel Bombardment"/> on MAMA and use <Skill name="Chilling Isolation"/>.

**1st Knight**   
* Use <Skill name="Shackling Wave"/> to deal damage and to apply a soft CC to the knight.
* Change to <Skill name="Legendary Renegade stance"/> to use <Skill name="Heroic Command"/> to share <Boon name="Might"/>.

**75-50%**
* Cast <Skill name="SoulcleavesSummit"/> under MAMA so your teammates get some extra damage and get some healing. If they are already at max health, you can save <Skill name="SoulcleavesSummit"/> for a bit later, since there will be a dome attack from MAMA after the first knight. Be sure to have around 25-35 energy at the end of the phase to be able to cast <Skill name="DarkrazorsDaring"/>.
* Share <Boon name="Alacrity"/> with <Skill name="Orders from Above"/> when off cooldown.
* Weapon swap to staff near the end of the phase.

**2nd Add**  
* Precast <Skill name="Darkrazors Daring"/> at the location where the add will spawn.
* Change to <Skill name="Legendary Centaur Stance"/>.
* Share <Boon name="Might"/> with <Skill name="Heroic Command"/>.


**50-25%**  
* Use <Skill name="Surge of the Mists"/> through MAMA, and weapon swap to swords.
* When MAMA is CC'd you should use your <Skill name="Citadel Bombardment"/> and <Skill name="Chilling Isolation"/> as they deal the largest amount of damage in your kit and there shouldn't be a need for heals. If your allies need heals, remember to use <Skill name="Natural Harmony"/>
* Change to <Skill name="Legendary Renegade stance"/> for the upcoming add.
* Share <Boon name="Alacrity"/> with <Skill name="Orders from Above"/> when off cooldown.

**3rd Add**  
* Precast <Skill name="Darkrazors Daring"/> and <Skill name="icerazors ire"/> where the add will spawn.
* Share <Boon name="Might"/> with <Skill name="Heroic Command"/>.
* Weapon swap to staff when possible.

**25-0%**  
* Use <Skill name="Warding Rift"/> for MAMAs shockwaves.
* Using <Skill name="Surge of the Mists"/> through MAMA to break the defiance bar.
* Weapon swap and change to <Skill name="Legendary Centaur Stance"/>.
* Cast your <Skill name="Citadel Bombardment"/> and <Skill name="Chilling Isolation"/> on MAMA once again when it's CC'd.

* Your prestacking is relatively simple and follows the same pattern on every boss. Cast <Skill name="Orders from Above"/> and <Skill name="Renewing Wave"/> and take the mistlock and cast them again.
* Ask your <Specialization name="Weaver"/> to precast <Skill name="Conjure Frost Bow"/> for your opening rotation. It is not needed, but it doesn't take anything away from the weaver and is a group DPS increase as well as 300 CC.

**100 - 66%**   
* Have your staff equipped and pick up the <Skill name="Conjure Frost Bow"/>.
* Precast <Skill name="Darkrazors Daring"/> and <Skill name="icerazors ire"/> and change to <Skill name="Legendary Centaur Stance"/> manually using the UI.
* Once the encounter begins cast <Skill name="Frost Storm"/>, <Skill name="Citadel Bombardment"/>, and <Skill name="Frost Fan"/>.
* Change to <Skill name="Legendary Renegade Stance"/>.
* Use <Skill name="Deep Freeze"/> and drop the <Skill name="Conjure Frost Bow"/>.
* Immediately use <Skill name="Surgeofthemists"/> to finish of the defiance bar.
* When you are through the hitbox weapon swap and use <Skill name="Chilling Isolation"/>.
* Share <Boon name="Might"/> at the end of the phase with <Skill name="Heroic Command"/>.

**1st Add**  
* Cast <Skill name="icerazors ire"/> on your designated echo.

* Let <Skill name="Soulcleaves summit"/> and <Skill name="Shackling wave"/> deplete your energy.
* Change to <Skill name="Legendary Centaur Stance"/> and be ready to start kiting the corrosive bubbles Siax casts. This is done by standing further away from the group (almost where the echoes spawn) and waiting for three green bubbles to be cast on you. Once Siax has cast this skill, you can return to your group and share <Boon name="Might"/> and <Boon name="Alacrity"/>.
* Swap back to <Skill name="LegendaryRenegadestance"/> and be ready to cast <Skill name="IcerazorsIre"/> where your designated echo will spawn.

**2nd Add**  
* Use <Skill name="IcerazorsIre"/> where the echo spawns and deal damage by using <Skill name="Chilling isolation"/> and your basic attacks.

**33-0%**  
* Share <Boon name="Alacrity"/> with <Skill name="Orders from Above"/>.
* Share <Boon name="Might"/> with <Skill name="Heroic Command"/>
* Cast <Skill name="SoulcleavesSummit"/> for the group and try to keep it up as much as possible.

* Use <Skill name="Surgeofthemists"/> to break the defiance bar. Swap to your swords and swap to <Skill name="LegendaryCentaurStance"/> and use your high damage skills (<Skill name="Chilling isolation"/> and <Skill name="Shackling wave"/>) when Ensolyss is <Effect name="Exposed"/>.
* Share <Boon name="Might"/> and <Boon name="Alacrity"/> with <Skill name="Ordersfromabove"/> and <Skill name="Heroic Command"/>.

**Orb Phase**
* Weapon swap to staff and change to <Skill name="Legendary Renegade Stance"/>.
* You should use <Skill name="Breakrazors Bastion"/> to keep your <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/>'s <Skill name="Frost spirit"/> alive.

**Annotation**
* In the case you are using <Skill name="LegendaryDwarfStance"/>, rotation is relatively the same. You will want to use <Skill name="Inspiring Reinforcement"/> in the last phase if Ensolyss teleports to the corner to give stability. For damage, you can use <Skill name="Vengeful hammers"/> to increase your DPS if you do not need to conserve energy.
