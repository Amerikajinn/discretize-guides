These rotations are **not** set in stone and therefore you should adjust your gameplay with how your party plays. Pay attention to the length of the phases, any upcoming CC that might be needed, and also pay attention to your energy and the management thereof.

**Precast**  
* Wait for your teammates to drop a fire field and in case you have a <Specialization name="Soulbeast"/>, wait until they use <Skill name="Moa Stance"/> which increases your boon duration by 20 %.
* Your prestacking is relatively simple and follows the same pattern on every boss. Cast <Skill name="Orders from Above"/> and <Skill name="Renewing Wave"/> and take the mistlock and cast them again.

**100-66%**  
* Precast <Skill name="Darkrazors Daring"/> when the <Specialization name="Weaver"/> is casting <Skill name="Meteorshower"/>.
* Cast <Skill name="Icerazors Ire"/> right before triggering the instance.
* Use <Skill name="Surge of the Mists"/> through Skorvald to break the defiance bar. Be aware of positioning to gain an extra hit.
* Weapon swap and change to <Skill name="Legendary Dwarf Stance"/>.
* Use your low energy skill <Skill name="Chilling Isolation"/> but save your energy for anomalies since you will provide stability for your whole team using <Skill name="Inspiring Reinforcement"/>.

**2nd Add**  
* Use <Skill name="SoulcleavesSummit"/> on the island as soon as you land on it. Blast the fire field with <Skill name="Renewing Wave"/>

---

**Annotation**
* Cast <Skill name="Citadel Bombardment"/> right as you jump the shockwave of the 2nd and 4th add. This can save you some time with a good party.
