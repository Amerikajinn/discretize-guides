# Team Composition

The current "meta" group setup for fractals consists of the following classes:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Chronomancer (1) | The Chronomancer's role consists of providing 100% <Boon name="quickness"/> uptime, good <Effect name="alacrity"/> uptime, strong utilities in terms of heavy crowd control, reflects, shared <Skill id="10192"/>, <Skill id="10197"/> skips, group <Effect name="stealth"/> and medium power DPS. It is by far the most important class in the team offering a combination of abilities like no other profession does. |
| Berserker (1) | The Condition Berserker provides strong party buffs in the form of <Skill id="14405"/>, <Skill id="14407"/> and <Trait id="1482"/>. It is also capable of providing strong CC and deals high condition DPS. |
| Druid (1) | The Druid significantly buffs the group's damage output with Frost Spirit, Sun Spirit, Glyph of Empowerement, 25x <Boon name="might"/>, <Boon name="fury"/> and Spotter while also providing party heals and condition cleanses. If required, it can even provide permanent <Boon name="protection"/> and Stability. |
| Weaver (1-2) | The Weaver is the typical damage dealer. Its main purpose is to deal as much damage as possible while providing minor utilities with Vulnerability, AoE Blind, a teleport and <Boon name="might"/> pre-stacking. Due to the immense damage increase from Tempest Defense, Elementalists are very strong in fractals as defiance bars are broken much more frequently than in raids. |
| Mirage (0-1) | The Mirage is another strong DPS option for longer fights like Arkk with access to the popular Mesmer utility skills, but doesn't do well with multiple targets. |

The only interchangeable slots in the prevailing team composition are the two DPS slots, which may be swapped with any other profession. While condition-based team setups are perfectly viable, power setups tend to outperform them in fractals due to <Item id="24868"/> and Slaying Potions like <Item id="50082"/>. Fights are also shorter than in raids and power classes usually benefit more from the additional precision from the <Item id="79722"/>.

# Usage of <Command name="gg"/>

As of late, it is possible to use the chat command <Command name="gg"/> within fractals to immediately kill your character (dead, not downed). This can be used generously in fractal skips, as it allows the entire party to teleport to a checkpoint once one player activates it.
If everyone in the party is dead at the same time, cooldowns will reset for all players. Therefore it is advised for the entire group to use <Command name="gg"/> at certain key positions to reset long cooldowns, like between Siax (2nd boss) and Ensolyss (3rd boss) in 99CM. Never resurrect as long as another player is still alive.

The command can also be used to recharge the Druid's <Skill id="31869"/> by having one player <Command name="gg"/> in front of a boss and letting the Druid resurrect him.

# Mistlock Instabilities

Tier 4 fractals always have three Mistlock Instabilities active which add additional mechanics to the fights. The selection is fixed for each difficulty level and specified in the top panel of each fractal guide.

Below is a list of all current instabilities and their possible countermeasures.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| <Instability name="Adrenaline Rush"/> | Enemies deal 50% more damage below 10% health. This also enhances special boss abilities, so be sure to finish mobs off quickly. |
| <Instability name="Afflicted"/> | Enemies apply random damaging conditions (<Condition name="bleeding"/>, <Condition name="burning"/>, <Condition name="confusion"/>, <Condition name="poison"/> and <Condition name="torment"/>). A good countermeasure is to have the Druid use <Skill id="12489"/> in combination with <Trait id="1075"/>. |
| <Instability name="Flux Bomb"/> | Causes players in combat to be randomly marked with Flux Bombs which leave a damaging and blinding AoE field behind. Do not place those inside the combat area, learn to dash away right before the field deploys. If you keep walking forward while marked you wont get any damage from the bomb. |
| <Instability name="Last Laugh"/> | Each enemy killed explodes within a 180 radius 1.75 seconds after its death, dealing high damage and <Control name="launch"/> to foes around it. Recognizable by a yellow zone after a mob's death. |
| <Instability name="Mists Convergence"/> | Causes a set of effects from other fractals to spawn, including *The Mossman*, a deadly *Champion Rabbit*, *Veteran Jade Maw Tentacles*, an *air strike* from the PvP map Skyhammer and the *cannon assault* from Captain Mai Trin Fractal. |
| <Instability name="No Pain, No Gain"/> | Enemies receive <Boon name="protection"/>, <Boon name="might"/> and <Boon name="fury"/> when you hit them. Has a 20 second internal cooldown per enemy, conveniently lining up with the Mesmer's <Skill id="10267"/>. |
| <Instability name="Social Awkwardness"/> | Players receive 1 stack of <Effect name="agony"/> and 10% health damage when they attack enemies while an ally is within a 44 unit range. This is the most annoying instability and active in almost all relevant T4 fractals. Spread out to prevent killing each other, but stay in melee range to keep benefiting from group buffs. |
| <Instability name="Toxic Trail"/> | Enemies leave a trail of poison behind them which inflicts direct damage and the <Condition name="poison"/> condition. Can be very dangerous when fighting multiple mobs. |
