            <td>The Chronomancer's role consists of providing 100% Quickness uptime, good Alacrity uptime, strong utilities in terms of heavy crowd control, reflects, shared <span data-armory-size="24" data-armory-embed="skills" data-armory-ids="10192" data-armory-inline-text="wiki"></span>, <Gw2Skill id={10197} inlineText={'wiki'}/> skips, group <a data-misc>Stealth</a> and medium power <abbr title="Damage Per Second">DPS</abbr>.
